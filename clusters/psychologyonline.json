Watson and Rosalie Rayner is one of the most influential, infamous and iconic research articles ever published in the history of psychology. Commonly referred to as \"The Case of Little Albert\" this psychology classic attempted to show how fear could be induced in an infant through classical conditioning. \r\n\r\nBonus Material:\r\n\r\nOne of the most dramatic aspects of Watson and Rayner's original study was that they had planned to test a number of methods by which they could remove Little Albert's conditioned fear responses. However, as Watson noted \"Unfortunately Albert was taken from the hospital the day the above tests were made. Hence the opportunity of building up an experimental technique by means of which we could remove the conditioned emotional responses was denied us.\"\r\n\r\nThis unforeseen turn of events was something that obviously stayed with Watson, as under his guidance some three years later, Mary Cover Jones conducted a follow-up study - A Laboratory Study of Fear: The Case of Peter - which illustrated how fear may be removed under laboratory conditions. This additional and highly relevant article is also presented in full.  \r\n\r\nIf you live outside the USA/UK, just go the Amazon website in your country and type the book title into the search box.\r\n\r\nNo kindle?

Watson and Rosalie Rayner is one of the most influential, infamous and iconic research articles ever published in the history of psychology. Commonly referred to as \"The Case of Little Albert\" this psychology classic attempted to show how fear could be induced in an infant through classical conditioning. \r\n\r\nBonus Material:\r\n\r\nOne of the most dramatic aspects of Watson and Rayner's original study was that they had planned to test a number of methods by which they could remove Little Albert's conditioned fear responses. However, as Watson noted \"Unfortunately Albert was taken from the hospital the day the above tests were made. Hence the opportunity of building up an experimental technique by means of which we could remove the conditioned emotional responses was denied us.\"\r\n\r\nThis unforeseen turn of events was something that obviously stayed with Watson, as under his guidance some three years later, Mary Cover Jones conducted a follow-up study - A Laboratory Study of Fear: The Case of Peter - which illustrated how fear may be removed under laboratory conditions. This additional and highly relevant article is also presented in full. \r\n\r\nIf you live outside the USA/UK, just go the Amazon website in your country and type the book title into the search box.\r\n\r\nNo kindle?

Official description/explantion was as follows:\n\n\"In this video, wooden balls roll up the slopes just as if they are pulled by a magnet. The behavior of the balls seems impossible, because it is against the gravity. The video is not a computer graphic, but a real scene. What is actually happening is that the orientations of the slopes are perceived oppositely, and hence the descending motion is misinterpreted as ascending motion. This illusion is remarkable in that it is generated by a three-dimensional solid object and physical motion, instead of a two-dimensional picture.\"\n\nThere is a page dedicated to optical illusions over at the main website.

The tune that does it for me everytime is Bizzare Love Triangle by New Order (http://youtu.be/W2Ii0K77K1k). \n\nThe eighties was my decade and this anthem transports me straight back there everytime, in fact I've got Frissons right now just thinking about it. \n\nSo What Does it For You?
