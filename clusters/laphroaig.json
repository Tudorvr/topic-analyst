We then blended it  (50:50) with some new spirit fully matured in quarter casks for 7 years and bottled it without any chill filtering for maximum flavour. It is at 51.2%ABV strength, which was one of the staff\u2019s ideas, so that the last 2 digits match the year of production .It\u2019s a fantastic \u2018coming of age\u2019 whisky, we hope you love it as much as we do! \r\n\r\nWill go on sale at our online shop W/C 18th June.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes.\r\nNose: With a nose that constantly evolves and is full of flavour Cairdeas Origin begins with a quick hint of concentrated orange moving quickly into huge peat flavours, ashy , dusty with hazelnut. It becomes crisp and fresh with cold green apples, grapes and finishing with a fresh cut grassy flavour.\r\n\r\nPalate: The flavours evolve slowly on the palate and with great body it begins with white pepper moving into an earthy peaty flavour, some slight salt then purple heather. Huge creamy apricots that last and last and it ends with some charred damp wood. Timeline Photos",

It\u2019s important to put the top layer back after cutting, so that the peat will be able to replenish itself over time. After all, it\u2019s been here for millions of years.\n\nThere aren\u2019t any forests like there are on the mainland, so our peat is made up of other decaying plant matter \u2013 namely heather, mosses and lichens. This makes for a different quality and flavour of peat.\nIt is the lichens that give our peat the medicinal flavours that are a hallmark of the Laphroaig flavour profile. Timeline Photos",
