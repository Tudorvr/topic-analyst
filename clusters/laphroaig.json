We then blended it  (50:50) with some new spirit fully matured in quarter casks for 7 years and bottled it without any chill filtering for maximum flavour. It is at 51.2%ABV strength, which was one of the staff\u2019s ideas, so that the last 2 digits match the year of production .It\u2019s a fantastic \u2018coming of age\u2019 whisky, we hope you love it as much as we do! \r\n\r\nWill go on sale at our online shop W/C 18th June.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes.\r\nNose: With a nose that constantly evolves and is full of flavour Cairdeas Origin begins with a quick hint of concentrated orange moving quickly into huge peat flavours, ashy , dusty with hazelnut. It becomes crisp and fresh with cold green apples, grapes and finishing with a fresh cut grassy flavour.\r\n\r\nPalate: The flavours evolve slowly on the palate and with great body it begins with white pepper moving into an earthy peaty flavour, some slight salt then purple heather. Huge creamy apricots that last and last and it ends with some charred damp wood. Timeline Photos",

This mixture gives us the unique smoke \u2013 the sweetness of the heather and mosses combined with the medicinal tang of the lichens. After about 12 to 13 hours the malted barley is fully \u2018peated\u2019. To complete the process we have to continue drying the malt down to 4.5% moisture content, which stops the germination process. We do this by using hot air, which has been heated by surplus hot water from our still house.\n\nWe peat first and dry later whereas other distilleries peat and dry at the same time. We do it this way as we find that it gives us a better all round flavour to our spirit. Timeline Photos",

It\u2019s important to put the top layer back after cutting, so that the peat will be able to replenish itself over time. After all, it\u2019s been here for millions of years.\n\nThere aren\u2019t any forests like there are on the mainland, so our peat is made up of other decaying plant matter \u2013 namely heather, mosses and lichens. This makes for a different quality and flavour of peat.\nIt is the lichens that give our peat the medicinal flavours that are a hallmark of the Laphroaig flavour profile. Timeline Photos",

The grains absorb the smoke (the Peat Reek) to give Laphroaig it\u2019s characteristic smoky flavour.\nThe process of drying is completed using warm air.\n \nResting: The malt is allowed to cool and rest for several weeks in one of our Malt Bins before passing to The Malt Mill.\n \nMilling: The malted barley is crushed through two sets of stainless steel rollers, to create grist, a mixture of husk material, coarse and fine flour. Sugars will be extracted from the grist in the mashing process.\n\nMy question for you - how long does the barley rest for? Timeline Photos",
