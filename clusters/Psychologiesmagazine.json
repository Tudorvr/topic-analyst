Out now\nAdd a new female heroine to your list: Harriet Burden, the \u2018rejected\u2019 artist who decides to play a gigantic revenge trick on the art world \u2013 she exhibits her work behind the masks of male artists to prove a point about gender bias, something that ultimately gets her into serious trouble. Via her diaries and the accounts of friends, enemies and academics who discuss her life and work, we enjoy fascinating snatches of psychology, neuroscience, feminism and philosophy. But this is also a mystery novel \u2013 we are asked to try and figure out just what kind of psychological game was being played. Burden is an angry woman, one with \u2018ideas dancing in her head like fireflies\u2019, and her fiery rage is \u2013 like feminism itself \u2013 at turns frustrating and moving but always meaningful, wonderful to experience. Those ideas that spill from every page are Husvedt\u2019s too, of course, a writer who deserves more and more of our precious time. Timeline Photos",

But that wasn\u2019t always the case \u2013 she had an older brother, Lowell, and an older sister, Fern. But Fern disappeared and Lowell ran away, leaving Rosemary to be brought up alone by her scientist parents. What starts off as a seemingly traditional narrative about a slightly unusual family suddenly grabs you by the throat and throws you off a cliff, as you desperately flip back through the pages to absorb a truly shocking twist. Without giving the plot away (because it\u2019s a corker), <We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves> is a moving portrait of an American family, and raises questions and feelings you never knew you had \u2013 about humanity, psychology and love in all its forms. It is a masterful novel, painful and memorable, and, like all the best novels, it will stay with you long afterwards. By Stacey Bartlett\n\n#books #review #worldbookday Timeline Photos",
