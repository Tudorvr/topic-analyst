          "Psychologies Book Review:\n\n'Burial Rites' by Hannah Kent (Picador, \u00a37.99)\nThis exquisite novel is based on the true case of Agnes Magnusdottir, the last woman to be executed in Iceland. Sentenced to death in 1829 for murdering her lover, Agnes spends what are to be her final months with a family who took her in. Evocative and emotional, this is a stunning piece of historical fiction. Timeline Photos",

          "It's World Book Day, so here's our book of the month review:\n\n'We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves' by Karen Joy Fowler (Profile, \u00a312.99)\n\nRosemary Cooke is an only child. But that wasn\u2019t always the case \u2013 she had an older brother, Lowell, and an older sister, Fern. But Fern disappeared and Lowell ran away, leaving Rosemary to be brought up alone by her scientist parents. What starts off as a seemingly traditional narrative about a slightly unusual family suddenly grabs you by the throat and throws you off a cliff, as you desperately flip back through the pages to absorb a truly shocking twist. Without giving the plot away (because it\u2019s a corker), <We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves> is a moving portrait of an American family, and raises questions and feelings you never knew you had \u2013 about humanity, psychology and love in all its forms. It is a masterful novel, painful and memorable, and, like all the best novels, it will stay with you long afterwards. By Stacey Bartlett\n\n#books #review #worldbookday Timeline Photos",
