But that wasn\u2019t always the case \u2013 she had an older brother, Lowell, and an older sister, Fern. But Fern disappeared and Lowell ran away, leaving Rosemary to be brought up alone by her scientist parents. What starts off as a seemingly traditional narrative about a slightly unusual family suddenly grabs you by the throat and throws you off a cliff, as you desperately flip back through the pages to absorb a truly shocking twist. Without giving the plot away (because it\u2019s a corker), <We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves> is a moving portrait of an American family, and raises questions and feelings you never knew you had \u2013 about humanity, psychology and love in all its forms. It is a masterful novel, painful and memorable, and, like all the best novels, it will stay with you long afterwards. By Stacey Bartlett\n\n#books #review #worldbookday Timeline Photos",
