          "Thank you Ivanka! I am so proud of you - keep up the GREAT WORK!! Ivanka Trump When my father takes office as the 45th President of the United States of America, I will take a formal leave of absence from The Trump Organization and my eponymous apparel and accessories brand. I will no longer be involved with the management or operations of either company.\n\nI have appointed Abigail Klem as president to lead my brand. She will work with a board of trustees to manage the strategic and day-to-day operations of the business; I am confident that under her leadership the company will continue creating smart, solution-oriented product and content. My brothers will oversee The Trump Organization, and I know that in their capable hands the business will thrive.\n\nMy husband, Jared, and I will be moving with our family to Washington, D.C., where Jared will serve as Senior Advisor to the President. I plan to take time to settle our three young children into their new home and schools.\n\nI'm grateful for the overwhelming amount of outreach I've received from people all across America who have shared their stories and offered to extend their ideas and expertise in the areas I am deeply passionate about, including the education and empowerment of women and girls; leveling the playing field for female entrepreneurs and job creators and unleashing the potential of women in the workplace. I am eager to hear more from them as I determine the most impactful and appropriate ways for me to serve our country.\n\nThank you to those of you who've lent your voices and perspective. To those of you I\u2019ve yet to meet, I look forward to working with you and for you.",

Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch comes after a selection process marked by an unprecedented level of transparency and involvement by the American voters.\n\n\u201cI am proud to announce the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for Justice of the Supreme Court,\u201d President Trump said. \u201cThis has been the most transparent and most important Supreme Court selection process in the history of our country and I wanted the American people to have a voice in this nomination. Judge Gorsuch has a superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its text. He will make an incredible Justice as soon as the Senate confirms him.\u201d\n\nJudge Gorsuch was born and raised in Colorado. He attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School. After graduating with honors, he received his doctorate from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar. Judge Gorsuch clerked for Judge David Sentelle of the D.C. Circuit and both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Following a successful career in private practice, Judge Gorsuch joined the Department of Justice as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General. In 2006, President George W. Bush nominated him for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and he was confirmed by voice vote without objection. He has served with distinction, earning a reputation as a brilliant jurist with an outstanding intellect and a clear, incisive writing style, and he is universally respected for his integrity and fairness to all parties.\n\n\u201cI am honored and humbled to receive this nomination,\u201d said Judge Gorsuch. \u201cI look forward to meeting with Senators over the coming weeks as we begin this process.\u201d Timeline Photos",

Trump\u2019s Trump University.  The three most important causes of actions have been thrown out entirely and the $40M damage claim is now down to a very small amount of money, if any.  The minor remaining portions of the case create a very heavy burden for the Attorney General to win, as his case is based on \u201cinadmissible, unsigned evidence,\u201d according to the Court ruling.  Schneiderman also lost his motion for summary judgment because there was no proof of any fraud whatsoever.  Indeed, the Court called out Schneiderman\u2019s \u201cevidentiary deficiencies.\u201d  \n\nMr. Trump stated \u201cEric Schneiderman is a total lightweight who is considered by many, including myself, to be the worst Attorney General in the United States.  He spent millions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money trying to build his name and reputation on publicity by going after me and now his entire case has been totally decimated. This all for a school that has a 98% approval rating from its students.  The Better Business Bureau has recently given the school an A rating.  In my opinion, he is a corrupt politician.  All you have to do is look at what is taking place with the Moreland Commission, etc.  Because of his frivolous lawsuits, many jobs are leaving New York City and New York State.  As soon as this case is over we will consider re-opening the school to all of our students and hire back the teachers and others, thereby creating lots of jobs for New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe publicity-mad Schneiderman is desperately trying to change his weak and ineffective image with the voters prior to election\u201d continued Mr. Trump. \u201cThe State desperately wanted to settle this case with me\u2014I have no interest in settling and most of the case is now won. Almost the entire case has been thrown out and the remainder totally weakened.  The original lawsuit was brought in the names of 10,000 students, almost all of whom signed affidavits praising the school, and is now reduced to less than 1,000 students. While the judge would not allow us to sue, at this time, for malicious prosecution, she stated that we can come back at a later date with this charge\u2014which we will.\u201d The highest fine for operating without a license in the history of New York has only been a few thousand dollars and we will appeal this part of the decision.\n\nSadly, certain newspapers did not cover this victory correctly and only spoke to Schneiderman and his people. The real fact is this has been almost a complete and total victory for Donald Trump and the school.",
