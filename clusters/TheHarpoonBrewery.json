It is brewed with a combination of wheat malt, pale malt, caramel malt, and mildly hopped with Willamette. The balance of malts and hops allows the distinct flavor and aroma of real Vermont maple syrup to take the lead.\n \nThe pure Vermont maple syrup used in the beer came from Baker Farm in East Dummerston\u2014the family farm of John Baker\u2014and Scrag Mountain Sugar House in Waitsfield.

An intense yet diverse hop addition schedule is executed during the boil that results in a well balanced offering.\r\n \r\nOn top of the Chinook, Simcoe, Cascade, and Citra hops is an ample addition of Ahtanum hops that provides a fruity aroma to complement the earthy, spicy bitterness of this dark ale.\r\n \r\nBrewed on: 12/15/11\r\nPackaged on: 1/5/12 \r\n \r\nBREWED BY\r\nHarpoon Brewer Matt Deluca\r\n \r\nAVAILABLE FROM \r\nJanuary 2012 to ....
