          "DAVID GILMOUR AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL IN AID OF TEENAGE CANCER TRUST \u2013  Sunday 24 April\n\nLast night David Gilmour and his band were delighted to perform a concert in aid of Teenage Cancer Trust, the last performance in nearly a week of shows for this incredible charity. The concert was the same production and set that David has been successfully touring since last Summer, most recently in the States.\n\nDuring the afternoon David and some of the band attended a music workshop to listen to two songs, \u2018Spreading Love\u2019 and \u2018Hope Is the Key\u2019 which the young people had written during the three hour workshop in the style of David Gilmour. The tracks were brilliant and the ovation was very well deserved. Barrie Knight, David\u2019s head of security for over 20 years, has worked with TCT on all their 16 Royal Albert Hall fundraisers, and he also got a rousing vote of thanks.\n\nTeenage Cancer Trust\u2019s fundraising concert series at the Royal Albert Hall began in 2000 with a concert by The Who and Friends, and Roger Daltrey is the charity\u2019s Honorary Patron. Through the proceeds raised by the concerts and the publicity created, Teenage Cancer Trust has created 28 specialist TCT units across the UK and currently funds 63 teenage cancer specialists.\n\nThe set list for last night\u2019s concert was the same as Madison Square Garden but with one notable difference: during the \u2018Comfortably Numb\u2019 finale David and the band segued into a brief rendition of the solo from \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 as a tribute to Prince.\n\nIt was another remarkable concert from David, with many fans visibly moved. He signed off with some words of support for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Next stop, Europe.\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb",

          "MADISON SQUARE GARDEN \u2013 New York 12 April\n\nTuesday night at Madison Square Garden was the final concert of David\u2019s North American tour, which began at the Hollywood Bowl 20 days ago. Somehow it seems longer; time has a habit of standing still on tour. The concerts have been an unmitigated success with David and the band scaling the heights of musical excellence, garnering rave reviews, drawing wonderful audiences who clearly loved every minute and evoking emotions in the fans that perhaps took them by surprise, such is the power of great music.\n\nDavid, having turned 70 this year, seems to have found another gear. This was his third concert in a row and he showed no signs of flagging; quite the reverse. He would be the first to acknowledge that he may be the maestro but he couldn\u2019t do what he does without a huge team effort from both his nine-piece band and his crew.  \n\nSo with this the final post of the North American tour, thank you and take a bow:\nDavid Gilmour, Phil Manzanera, Jon Carin, Guy Pratt, Steve DiStanislao, Kevin McAlea, Joao Mello, Bryan Chambers, Louise Marshall and Lucita Jules.\n\n\u2018The time is gone, the song is over\u2019\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb",

          "MADISON SQUARE GARDEN \u2013 New York 11 April\n\nIf you ask people, name a famous concert venue in America, the one that is most likely to come to mind is Madison Square Garden. Located in midtown Manhattan, this 18,000 capacity venue, sits on top of the equally famous Pennsylvania station. During David Gilmour's soundcheck there was a palpable feeling of excitement that perhaps the night would be one of those special ones.\n\nWhen David and the band walked on the stage, the audience gave them a standing ovation and that set the tone for the night. Not since South America has \u2018Wish You Were Here\u2019 been sung with such gusto. They roared, they cheered, they chanted \u2018David\u2019 and the band responded, led by the maestro, \u2018knocking it out the park\u2019 on every track.\n\nFor the many guitar fans in the audience, Marc Brickman, projects many shots of David\u2019s \u2018wide\u2019 fingers bending and pushing the strings with bewildering accuracy. It also shows close-ups of his famous guitars to good effect, with the trusty black Strat taking a lot of the electric load.\n\nStevie di Stanislao\u2019s drumming is rock solid, propelling the band forward and giving David a powerful beat to play off. There is a saying that \u2018a band is only as good as its drummer\u2019, but perhaps a drummer said that.

The point where the giant University scarves are released has been cheered throughout the \u2018Rattle That Lock\u2019 tour.\n\nAs the end of this magnificent concert David thanked the audience and said \u201cI hope you all had as good a time as I have.\u201d\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb",

          "RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL \u2013 New York, 10 April\n\nWaking up to the perfect sunny Spring day in New York put everyone in the mood for David Gilmour's concert at Radio City Music Hall, also known as the Showplace of the Nation. This 6,000 seater iconic venue, built in the Art Deco style, opened in 1932 and still features the famous annual Christmas Spectacular with The Rockettes.  Steve di Stanislao, the band\u2019s drummer, causally mentioned that his Grandma did a stint as a Rockette: impressive grandma credentials Stevie.\n\nThere were quite a few latecomers and it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that the concert does start at 8pm.  \n\nThe watery couplet of \u2018A Boat Lies Waiting\u2019 and \u2018The Blue\u2019 worked beautifully in this intimate and grand theatre, with its apricot velvet seats and gold drapes adorning the proscenium arch.\n\nThe sound of cash registers drew a roar of recognition followed by the famous bass riff, as \u2018Money\u2019 got underway in all its musical greatness.  This was followed by \u2018Us and Them\u2019, a Waters/Wright composition and another track from \u2018The Dark Side of The Moon\u2019. The \u2018Us and Them\u2019 film, show on the giant circular screen, opens with a grey, London day and then cuts to New York, and aerial views of the skyscraper city, perhaps including this venue.\n\nLouise Marshall, Lucita Jules and Bryan Chambers, \u2018the glorious singers\u2019, make a huge impact with not only their singing but their synchronized dance moves; during the \u2018Shine On\u2019 sax solo they mirrored Joao\u2019s fingers on the keys.\n\nDavid\u2019s virtuoso playing during \u2018Sorrow\u2019 drew a standing ovation, and the audience remained on their feet for the encore of Time/ Breathe and Comfortably Numb.  As David and the band took their final bow, he told them \u2018You\u2019ve been a great New York audience\u2019.  Next stop, Madison Square Garden.\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, On An Island, \nToday, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb",

Before each concert there is a series of sound effects which have various Pink Floyd references, a plane flying overhead, the sound of a helicopter, birds song, a man talking: some may notice, others are too caught up in the anticipation of the concert, cheering the movement of the guitar techs as they do their final tuning.\n\nTonight the fans were on their feet from the start, cheering and roaring on every song, and giving a warm round of applause to Joao Mello\u2019s terrific sax solo in \u2018Us and Them\u2019.\n\nIn the audience were Richard Wright\u2019s daughter, son and grandson; he is sorely missed and remembered by the song, \u2018A Boat Lies Waiting\u2019, which features Richard\u2019s spoken voice.\n\nSteve di Stanislao was again magnificent on drums, powering the band along and his striking of the bell at the beginning of \u2018High Hopes\u2019 is always a concert highlight.\n\nThe lasers during \u2018Comfortably Numb\u2019 ratchet up the excitement, matching David\u2019s soloing and providing powerful visual images to accompany one of the most iconic guitar solos in rock history.\n\nThe band took their final bow and it was time to leave Chicago and head for the final stage of the tour, New York.  Chicago had one final surprise as the band exited the venue: three inches of snow had fallen during the concert.\n\nFor the 48-strong crew it was three hours more hard work, breaking the set down, loading the seven trucks and driving the 790 miles, through the night, to New York.\n\nThe set list had an extra song with the inclusion of \u2018On An Island.\u2019\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb",

          "The Auditorium Theatre, Chicago, 6 April\n\nFaced with a three day gap between the two mammoth concerts at The United Center, David Gilmour suggested bridging it with a concert at the city\u2019s historic The Auditorium Theatre.  This meant that the magnificent crew, led by Phil Taylor and Roger Searle, had to load out of The United Center and somehow make all the gear fit into the small theatre and then return it to the arena for Friday\u2019s concert: the screen along weighs 6 tons.  \n\nDavid last played this small 3,800 seater with Pink Floyd in April 1972, 44 years ago, but he wasn\u2019t the only one returning to an old haunt, as bandmate Phil Manzanera played there with Roxy Music in 1975.\n\nThis architectural gem of a theatre was completed in 1889 and became the tallest building in the city and the largest in the US, today it is on the National Register of Historic Places.  The ambition was to make it the world\u2019s grandest theatre to rival the Met in New York.  Arriving for soundcheck the beauty and elegance of the \u2018golden\u2019 auditorium was enchanting to behold, with its four ellipse-shaped arches directing sound outward to the audience.  \n\nThe opulence of the surroundings seemed to affect the audience, almost as much as what they were witnessing on stage, they were still, caught in the moment, watching David and the band  perform, and then after each song, roar into life.   It was another great performance, with the fans enjoying the Rattle that Lock songs as well as the Pink Floyd favourites.  The songs from the Division Bell album were cheered enthusiastically, with \u2018High Hopes\u2019 and \u2018Coming Back to Life\u2019.  During the barnstorming \u2018Run Like Hell\u2019 Guy Pratt showed that he can still run as fast as when he first performed the song aged 25.  \n\nThroughout the concert the sound was crystal clear, a combination of Colin Norfield\u2019s brilliance as a sound mixer and the wonderful acoustics of this fine building.  The concert of course was David\u2019s triumph but perhaps the venue shone just as brightly.\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb",

Muddy Waters and Howlin\u2019 Wolf are just two of the Chicago singer/songwriters who significantly influenced many British rock musicians in the 60\u2019s, of which David Gilmour was one.\n\nEach night, during the concert, a guitar \u2018choreography\u2019 takes place, to which the audience is oblivious, and that\u2019s a mark of its success.  Phil Taylor (production director) and David\u2019s long-serving guitar tech has 16 guitar changes to make during the concert, Steve Prior, guitar tech to Phil Manzanera, has 14, and \u2018Alfie\u2019 Barton\u2019, Guy Pratt\u2019s bass tech, also has 14 changes: this constant activity on and off the stage invariably takes place in the dark or in blinding light, but such is the brilliance of Phil Taylor\u2019s \u2018choreography\u2019 that it is flawless\u2026and incident free.\n\nLast night\u2019s concert maintained the high standard of the tour, the audience loving every moment and David conjuring magic from the guitar and the voice.  Special mention goes to Joao Mello, who although struggling with illness, played his usual brilliant sax. \n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb",

The audience took up where their compatriots last night left off, cheering and clapping from start to finish.  A great audience spurs a band on, they feel the vibe, and so it was tonight.  David\u2019s singing and guitar solos were at the highest level, support by his superb band which gave him the context to \u2018shine on\u2019.  But concerts at this level are a team effort, everyone in the crew plays their part to make the band sound great, and no-one more so than Colin Norfield, sound engineer, out there with his desk wrestling the challenges that different venues present, and always winning: throughout the Rattle that Lock tour, the quality of the sound has been noted by fans and reviewers.  \n\nTonight \u2018The Blue\u2019, from the \u2018On An Island\u2019 album, sounded particularly moving, with the giant round screen showing close ups of string bending and mind blowing fret work, those in the know would have also admired the Jimi Hendrix cross stitched guitar strap.  \u2018Fat Old Sun\u2019 is a huge crowd pleaser with some tasty lap steel played by Jon Carin.  Before David introduced the band, the 14000 capacity crowd gave him and them a standing ovation, this was a concert first; after the introductions a lady audience member (and there aren\u2019t that many of them) sagely observed, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of talent in that band.\u201d\n\nThe deep growling of the guitar sound on \u2018Sorrow\u2019 feels like it\u2019s been conjured up from a subterranean world and tends to still the audience, as they wonder what exactly is coming next.\n\nA local critic observed of David\u2019s performance here, \u201che\u2019s left the concert performance bar raised as high as when Pink Floyd first set it, nearly half a century ago.\u201d\n\nThanks Toronto, you\u2019ve been great, next stop Chicago.\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb",

The red and white circular venue, like the Bowl, has a famous history, best know as the home of the NBA Lakers until 1999.  It was designed in 1967 to evoke the forum in Rome, so while not quite as old as the amphiheatres David will be playing this Summer, it does fit the bill as a venue of 'special historic interest'. And nothing 'funny happened on the way'\u2026in fact the LA traffic was lighter than usual.\n\nTonight's set list was the same as Friday's concert again with the popular inclusion of What Do You Want From Me, a co-write from Gilmour, Wright and Samson. The singing of Bryan Chambers, Louise Marshall and Lucita Jules, is one of the many highlights of the evening, their soaring vocals and great moves catch the eye and the ear.\n\nThe 12,000 fans cheered and roared their approval throughout the evening both for the new songs and for the Pink Floyd evergreens. A Boat Lies Waiting is becoming a classic, the whole band come together and sing as a choir probably thinking of the great Richard Wright, who inspired this song. In Any Tongue received a standing ovation.\n\nOnce again Money proves to be a tour de force, with David taking new twists and turns with the solos and Joao Mello thrilling throughout the concert with his sax playing.\n\nIn British understatement David asked \"Are you having a reasonable time?\" and 12,000 voices shouted \"Yes\". He introduced the band, and local boy Steve di Stanislao, got an extra big cheer as did El Magnifico, Phil Manzanera.\n\nThe lasers during Comfortably Numb lit the domed roof of the forum making it look like a spacecraft about to land; perhaps there is somebody 'out there' after all.\n\nSet list:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb",

Tonight's performance of Money, accompanied by the images of money cascading down the front and sides of the Bowl, was probably one of the best ever, bringing the ecstatic audience to its feet.

          "DAMIAN BARR\u2019S NEW YORK LITERARY SALON \u2013 9 April\n\nThis evening the Ace Hotel hosted Damian Barr\u2019s New York Literary salon with Polly Samson, Jonathan Lee and David Gilmour.  Damian is himself a critically acclaimed author, \u2018Maggie and Me\u2019, as well as London\u2019s leading literary \u2018salonista\u2019. \n\nThe salon\u2019s first session was with Polly, whose new rave-reviewed novel, \u2018The Kindness\u2019 as well as the sublime, \u2018Perfect Lives\u2019, have both recently been published in the US and Canada. Polly read an extract from \u2018The Kindness\u2019 and then Damian, who is a charming, witty and erudite interlocutor, asked her about the novel, its genesis and her unique approach to writing. The audience, which included fellow authors Jon Ronson (\u2018The Psychopath Test) and Neil Gaiman (\u2018The Sandman\u2019) were clearly captivated by Polly\u2019s eloquent and humourous account of her writing life and the challenges \u2018The Kindness\u2019 presented, some involving looking a sperm under a microscope: to understand this reference, read the book.\n\nJoining Damian next was Jonathan Lee, a British, New York-based writer, who is best known for his novels \u2018Who Is Mr Satoshi\u2019, \u2018Joy\u2019, and his new book, \u2018High Dive\u2019 \u2013 the Guardian newspaper described him as \u2018a major new voice in British fiction.\u2019  Jonathan read an extract from \u2018High Dive\u2019 which is based on events prior to the bombing of The Grand Hotel in Brighton. Coincidentally, Polly\u2019s book of short stories \u2018Perfect Lives\u2019 is also set in Brighton.\n\nDamian\u2019s final session was with David and Polly, discussing their very successful music writing partnership.  Invariably David will play Polly several pieces of music and she will see where her lyrical muse takes her; she explained that she listens to the music on her iPod and walks miles mulling it over and writing in her head.  Damian asked if there were ever occasions when David rejected the lyrics and he replied \u2018only once\u2019, most of the time they are \u2018perfect\u2019. It was a good note to end on.",

          "POLLY SAMSON\u2019S BOOKSTORE EVENTS \u2013 23 and 30 March\nIn the last week, Polly has attended two very successful bookstore events to coincide with the North American publication of The Kindness and Perfect Lives.  \n\nOn the 23 March one of LA\u2019s leading bookstores, The Last Bookstore, hosted the event and the interviewer was David Ulin, former books editor and critic for the Los Angeles Times.  Polly spoke about The Kindness with David Ulin before being joined by David Gilmour, where they talked about their chart topping writing collaborations: four number one albums so far.  The event filled the shop to capacity and the signing line took a couple of hour to complete; the bookstore was delighted.  \n\nThe second event took place a week later, on the other side of this vast North American continent, in Toronto.  Ben McNally Books hosted the event in their charming art deco book shop, and Ben was the interviewer.   Following Polly\u2019s reading of an extract from The Kindness, Ben asked her about where the story had come from and about her writing process. He commented that \u201cit is a tremendous book and you are a brilliant writer.\u201d  Talking about her writing process, Polly said that for her it\u2019s not about \u201cgetting your bottom on a seat,  it\u2019s about getting on your feet\u201d as she explained that she walks for miles \u2018writing\u2019 in her head, both her prose and lyrics.  Polly was then joined by David who described their writing partnership as \u2018magical\u2019.",

Chosen from 50 records nominated by a panel of highly respected music design experts and previous Best Art Vinyl Award winners, the covers demonstrate a complete range of creative disciplines, including traditional fine art, photography, sculpture and computer graphics. \n\nThe concept and production for David Gilmour's cover was created by The Creative Corporation, art directed by Dave Stansbie in collaboration with Aubrey 'Po' Powell from the legendary Hipgnosis design studio, who produced album covers for Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, 10cc and many others during the 60's, 70's and 80's.\n\nDavid Gilmour said: \"I am thrilled that the artwork to Rattle That Lock has received the ArtVinyl award. I'd like to offer my congratulations and thanks to Dave Stansbie and the team at The Creative Corporation for the brilliant work that they have done for me. It's a thrill to see vinyl making a comeback and the return of the opportunities that the larger format offers. Thanks again\".\n\nBest Art Vinyl founder Andrew Heeps explains, \"This is the first year such an established artist's record has won Best Art Vinyl, but notably the design team have historically been responsible for so many iconic sleeve designs and their talent and creativity to match the musicians' wishes clearly shone through. It's interesting that two of the top three are conceptual compositions, using photography as the core of the design and all three use digital design skills to great effect, showing that designers are using all tools available to them throughout the creative process. We believe this is a unique art prize that really taps into popular culture, as the created artwork is used to not just sell the product but to enhance the listeners' overall experience.\"\n\nIn January 2016, the winners of the Best Art Vinyl 2015 award will feature in exhibitions in London, Scotland, Italy, Germany and Hungary as well as on www.artvinyl.com.

          "HOLLYWOOD BOWL \u2013 24 March\nIn the week that David Gilmour announced that he would be playing Pompeii, the world\u2019s oldest amphitheatre, it seems appropriate that he opens his North American tour with a concert in the world's largest natural amphitheatre, the Hollywood Bowl.  The famous white shell of the venue shone in the early evening sunshine as the capacity 16,000 audience crackled with anticipation to see David and the band, after an absence of 10 years take to the stage.  It was the first time that a concert had played at the Bowl in March, normally the concert season starts in May.\n\nUnder a pyramid of light in the night sky, the concert opened with 5 A.M and soon the first of Marc Brickman's pixel mapping on the exterior shell of the dome was revealed as the birds from Rattle That Lock fluttered and flew from the perimeter out into the audience.  Marc deployed 30 projectors to create stunning lighting effects using the dome as his canvas: Money had cascades of coins pouring down the sides of the bowl, Astronomy Domine was a psychedelic coloured bubble explosion and Run got even more crazy with coloured shapes running riot across the perimeter of this historic venue.  And then there were the spectacular fireworks, shooting out from the roof of the bowl; such was the power of the display that the clear night sky clouded over with the smoke.\n\nA further treat was in store for the Hollywood audience with the appearance of the great David Crosby, singing A Boat Lies Waiting, On An Island and Comfortably Numb.\n\nDavid and the band played a blinder but tonight, the show was equally about Marc Brickman's stunning and very beautiful lighting effects\u2026for one more night only.\n\nFirst set: 5 A.M., Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

          "Saturday's flight over the Andes on the approach to Santiago, Chile, gave a majestic sight to behold. Once in the city, the landscape continues to inspire, with snowcapped peaks seeming to peep out from behind the city\u2019s modern skyline. The drama of this Chilean modern metropolis added to the air of excitement and anticipation for David Gilmour\u2019s final concert in South America:  one national newspaper described the concert as the most eagerly anticipated of the year.\n\nThe Estadio Nacional, the concert venue, is Chile\u2019s Wembley Stadium, and is well used to staging major sporting and music events. The 47,000 fans roared their welcome as David and the band took to the stage. \u2018Money\u2019 took a different turn this evening as David unexpectedly called on Guy to play a bass solo, which he did with aplomb. He then told the audience, \u201cI\u2019m going to whistle for you now\u201d and \u2018In Any Tongue\u2019 began. During the band introductions Phil, aka El Magnifico, said a few words in Spanish to the audience\u2026.\u201dVival Chile, Viva Los Chilenos\u201d, which drew an enthusiastic response.\n\nDuring this tour, David\u2019s virtuoso guitar playing, brilliantly supported by Phil, Guy, Jon, Stevie, Kevin, Joao, Lucita and Bryan, has been lauded by fans and media. But special mention must go to the incredibly hard working and professional crew, led by Roger Searle, who make these concerts happen. Throughout the Rattle that Lock tour, the sound and lighting have been raved about: Colin Norfield makes the band sound great, night after night, wrestling the different challenges that each venue presents, and Marc Brickman is the lighting magician, who conjures his visual spells, and creates a light show rarely equalled.\n\nAs David and the band left the stadium, with the crowd\u2019s cheering still ringing in their ears, David reflected:\n\n\"I'm glad I've finally played in South America, it took me 50 years, but perhaps I've appreciated it more at this period of my life. I'll be taking home many happy memories. Obrigado and gracias.\"\n\nHere's what was played last night:\n\nFirst set: 5 A.M., Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

          "Yesterday Clarin, one of Argentina\u2019s national newspapers, declared of David Gilmour\u2019s first ever concert in Argentina, \u2018La Visita que faltaba\u2019, the visit that was needed. And the \u2018visit\u2019 duly took place for 70,000 excited fans at the Hipodromo de San Isidro, the local racecourse, 15 minutes from the centre of Buenos Aires. However, as David and the band discovered, the journey time became nearly two hours, thanks to a combination of thousands of cars heading to the concert and others leaving BA for the Christmas holidays. Traffic ground to a standstill and the hapless two police outriders were helpless in the face of overwhelming odds. It was a relief to finally arrive at the venue but the concert had to be delayed for half an hour to allow the fans to catch up. Once inside the venue it was apparent that Buenos Aires (good winds) was living up to its name with a wind swirling across the audience creating an uncharacteristic chilly December evening. Luckily the huge crowd, the biggest by far of the tour, seem to draw warmth from the music and in turn responded with enthusiasm and passionate singing. The crowd had waited many years to hear the voice and guitar of Pink Floyd and roared their approval to hear the classics; they also gave a warm reception to the new songs from \u2018Rattle That Lock\u2019.  \n\nHere's what was played last night:\n\nFirst set: 5 A.M., Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

The 40,000 crowd greeted David Gilmour's band with a deafening roar and the stadium sparkled with the lights from thousands of mobile phones. The set list was the same as Curitiba, which meant a reprise of the ever popular \u2018Coming Back to Life. Tonight \u2018The Blue\u2019 from David\u2019s previous No 1 album, \u2018On An Island\u2019, shimmered and \u2018In Any Tongue\u2019, from \u2018Rattle That Lock\u2019, had the crowd transfixed by Danny Madden\u2019s war animation.  The stadium \u2018choir\u2019 sang the Pink Floyd classics, culminating in the finale, \u2018Comfortably Numb\u2019.  David thanked the audience for being so great and it was time to bid Brazil farewell and to reflect on David\u2019s first ever concerts in the country. There are so many highlights from the four concerts but the warmth and the passion of the Brazilian audiences, as well as their singing and chanting, will live long in the memory. \n\nPS: Special mention must go to Fabiano and his family for the balloons and RUN banners of Curitiba.\n\nHere's what was played last night:\n\nFirst set: 5 A.M., Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

          "Last night's concert venue in Curitiba was an old limestone quarry, with 30 metre rock walls and a tree lined perimeter. All 25,000 fans were standing and, like in Sao Paulo, chanted and sang throughout the two hour set. It was an extra special evening for two members of David's team: for Joao Mello, the young saxophonist, who was playing in front of his home crowd, and for Phil Taylor, David's guitar tech for over 40 years, celebrating his birthday. David called Phil onto the stage and the whole audience sang Happy Birthday, or the Portuguese equivalent. Joao spoke briefly to the audience and they applauded their 'own'.\n\nThere was a song added to the set-list, the hugely popular 'Coming Back to Life', which 'On An Island' made way for. The release of the scarves in 'High Hopes' has received a huge cheer here in Brazil, which hasn't been the case previously. \n\nAnd the crowd had two surprises in store for David and the band: during 'The Girl in the Yellow Dress' a cloud of coloured balloons was released which wafted across the audience, seemingly in time to the music, and for 'Run Like Hell', the final song of the set, before the encore, a group of fans in the front row held up handpainted posters each with 'RUN' on them. For the final few songs the rain poured and there were flashes of lightning, but no-one cared, and the concert ended with a moving 'Comfortably Numb'. As David said \"You\u2019ve been a fantastic audience\".\n\nHere's what was played last night:\n\nFirst set: 5 A.M., Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

          "When lighting genius Marc Brickman says of last night's concert \"that was David's best concert ever\" you know that something very special took place. The atmosphere in the stadium was crackling with anticipation as the 45,000 chanted \"David Gilmour\", led by the 'standing room' only fans on the pitch. The afternoon thunderstorms had cleared and everyone was ready to enjoy a concert that they had waited many years to witness. The sea of iPhone lights twinkled around the stadium as the band began the opening '5 A.M.'. Between songs the chanting would start up, and at one point, just before 'A Boat Lies Waiting' David had to gently ask for some quiet.\n\nLast night 'Money', 'Fat Old Sun' and 'Comfortably Numb' had rarely been played better, the extended improvised soloing saw David's playing scale the heights, supported superbly by the band, who all seemed to be inspired by the wonderful audience. David told them: \"How beautifully you are singing\". \n\nAs the band leave S\u00e3o Paulo for the next leg of the tour, they will take with them great memories of both concerts, not least the powerful sound of over 45,000 voices accompanying them.\n\nHere's what was played last night:\n\nFirst set: 5 A.M., Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

And then a huge roar, which signalled the arrival of David and the band to the stage, with one newcomer, Lucita Jules, singing backup vocals with Bryan Chambers. The roar then became a chant, \"Ole, Ole, Ole, Gilmour, Gilmour\", which was then repeated throughout the concert. The band were on great form, taking up where they left off in London, but this time with a 'choir' of 40,000 joining in and singing along to the Pink Floyd favourites.

          "Darkside, the play written by Sir Tom Stoppard for BBC Radio 2, incorporating music from Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, and aired in the UK at the end of August, is released worldwide as a deluxe CD package on 25 November 2013.\r\n\r\nProduced in collaboration with Sir Tom\u2019s publishers Faber and Faber, the luxury package resembles a hard-backed book, including a CD carrying the 54-minute play, which includes the majority of the Dark Side of the Moon album, plus a 56-page bound insert of the play\u2019s script. The cover features artwork by Hipgnosis designer Aubrey \u2018Po\u2019 Powell in collaboration with StormStudios, based on the specially-created Aardman Animations piece used to publicise the broadcast. The full play script includes all the dialogue and stage directions, plus Roger Waters\u2019 original lyrics from the album. The release also features a bonus disc with text translations in German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, Mandarin and Russian.\r\n\r\nTom Stoppard said: \u201cWhen The Dark Side of the Moon was a new album in 1973, a friend of mine walked into my room where I was working with a copy in his hand and said \u201cYou really have to do a play about this album.\u201d So, when, roughly 39-and-a-half years later, Jeff Smith from Radio 2 asked me if I\u2019d like to do some kind of play around the 40th birthday of the Pink Floyd album, it really wasn\u2019t a very difficult decision.\u201d\r\n\r\nDarkside is an abstract and compelling drama which follows Emily, a philosophy student, through a series of thought experiments, which are vividly brought to life. The play also ranges over a series of grand themes, which are both thought provoking and laced with Stoppard\u2019s characteristic wit and humour. The cast is impressive, with Bill Nighy as Dr Antrobus/the Witch Finder, Rufus Sewell is Mr Baggott/Ethics Man, Adrian Scarborough is Fat Man and Amaka Okafor is Emily. \r\n\r\nDavid Gilmour: \u201cI found the script of Tom\u2019s play fascinating; I can\u2019t think of a better way to celebrate The Dark Side of The Moon\u2019s 40 year anniversary.\u201d\r\n\r\nNick Mason: \u201cI love it. If anyone is going to mess with the crown jewel of albums, Tom is a very good choice.\u201d\r\n\r\nBill Nighy: \u201cTo get a combination of Tom Stoppard and Pink Floyd\u2026is a massive deal, a marriage made in radio heaven.\u201d Timeline Photos",
