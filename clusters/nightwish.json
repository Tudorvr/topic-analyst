          "TUOMAS HOLOPAINEN \u2013 First details about the solo album \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge\u00ab\r\n\r\nTuomas has spent most of the year 2013 writing and producing his solo album. The whole album will be based on a graphic novel called \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge McDuck\u00ab, written and illustrated by Don Rosa.\r\n\r\nTuomas comments: \u201cThis is my longtime dream come true, 14 years in the making. And a homage to one of the best storytellers of our time. Thank you for sharing this celebration of Life & Adventure!\"\r\n\r\nThis 12 - chapter book tells the life story of a certain Scrooge, from his early years in the 19th century Scotland to his adventures all around the world until the 1950`s. The story contains such immense depth, detail, wit and emotional power, that the moment Tuomas read it nearly 20 years ago, it instantly became a story of profound personal interest and love for him. The initial spark of `coloring` this story with music, i.e. create a kind of \"soundtrack\" for the book, came to him already in 1999, and has ever since been haunting the back of his mind.\r\n\r\nThe album was written and produced by Tuomas Holopainen and will contain 10 songs, with total duration of approximately 60 minutes. The music will be of soundtrack / classical / folk genre in the vein of Vaughan Williams, Michael Nyman, James Newton Howard and Enya.\r\n\r\nMr. Pip Williams has done the orchestral arrangements, continuing his collaboration with Tuomas after the NIGHTWISH records \u00bbOnce\u00ab, \u00bbDark Passion Play\u00ab & \u00bbImaginaerum\u00ab.\r\n\r\nThere will be a number of guest musicians, including the London Orchestra, The Metro Voices (a choir from London) and four lead vocalists: Alan Reid, Johanna Kurkela, Johanna Iivanainen & Tony Kakko. Other guest appearances include Troy Donockley (uilleann pipes, low whistles, bodhran), Mikko Iivanainen (guitars & banjo), Teho Majam\u00e4ki (Didgeridoo), Jon Burr (Harmonica) and Dermot Crehan in the solo violin.\r\nThe recordings took place during August - October 2013, first at Angel Studios, London, then in various locations around Scotland and Finland.\r\n\r\nThe author of the book, Don Rosa, has done the artwork for the album.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a single release, from the track \u2018A Lifetime Of Adventure\u2019, and a music video to go with it in early 2014.\r\nThe album \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge\u00ab is scheduled for a release in April 2014.

Nightwish and Anette Olzon have decided to part company, in mutual understanding, for the good of all parties involved.\n\nIn recent times it has become increasingly obvious that the direction and the needs of the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover.\n\nNightwish has no intention of cancelling any upcoming shows, and as a result we have decided to bring in a substitute vocalist starting in Seattle 1.10.2012. Her name is Floor Jansen from The Netherlands (ex-After Forever, ReVamp), and she has graciously stepped in to help us complete the Imaginaerum world tour.\n\nWe are all strongly committed to this journey, this vehicle of spirit, and we are sure that this will lead to a brighter future for everyone.\n\nWe forever remain excited about the adventures to come, and we are extremely proud of the two beautiful albums and the wonderful shows we shared together.\n\n- NIGHTWISH & Anette Olzon",

But while looking into the future we look back to the recording of this album in this 10th trailer.\nCheck it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YoyRFF3KY\nHere is a personal comment on this episode by Tuomas: \n\u201cThe writing process was extremely smooth and relatively easy. I had more fun than ever during the recordings. The R\u00f6sk\u00f6 summer camp was a lot of fun. The days were filled with friendship, hope and music. Obviously the sad thing was that Jukka had to step aside \u2013 but everything else has been really good.\u201d\nAnd Marco added: \u201cThe songs did grow during the process. We started out with Tuomas\u2019 computer demos and my own demos. We put them together \u2013 and started building the songs around those basic blocks. They really grew in depth and character along the way.\u201d\nWe recently revealed the track listing and different formats of \u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab which will be released as follows:\nJewelcase\n01.

          "We're getting closer to the release of Endless Forms Most Beautiful (out on March 27th (EU), 30th (UK) and 31st (US))!!! We'd like to share more about the themes and the inspiration of the album in this twelfth \u201cmaking-of\u201d trailer!\nCheck it out here: http://youtu.be/3hSB4ENrQKc\n\nTuomas comments: \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of scientific approach to a lot of things on the album. Songs like \u2018Shudder Before The Beautiful\u2019, \u2018Endless Forms Most Beautiful\u2019, \u2018The Greatest Show On Earth\u2019 or \u2018Alpenglow\u2019 all somehow reflect the bliss of existence. It\u2019s temporary character. Evolution\u2026Maybe you could even talk about the poetic nature of science. Natural science and its paradigm \u2013 seem to represent something cold and boring to a lot of people. Hopefully we can illustrate with this album \u2013 that science can even be something profoundly spiritual.\u201d\n \nStand-in drummer Kai Hahto adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect theme to an album. Like, how did we come to be? And when our time here is done, what kind of mark do we leave? It\u2019s a pretty amazing theme.\u201d\n \nThe track list for \u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab reads as follows:\n \n01. Shudder Before The Beautiful\n02. Weak Fantasy\n03. \u00c9lan\n04. Yours Is An Empty Hope\n05. Our Decades In the Sun\n06. My Walden\n07. Endless Forms Most Beautiful\n08. Edema Ruh\n09. Alpenglow\n10. The Eyes Of Sharbat Gula\n11.

We set sail for the ultimate journey in March 2015, join us!\u201d, adds Tuomas Holopainen secretly. \n\nThe detailed cover-artwork was created by longtime collaborator Toxic Angel. \n\u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab features eleven new songs and will be released in different formats: \n\nStandard CD \nDigibook (incl. instrumental CD)\n2LP (vinyl in gatefold) in different colours \nEarbook (incl. instrumental and orchestral CD)\nEarbook (deluxe version incl. bonus vinyl)\nDownload \n\nPre-order your copy here: http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISH-Endless\n\nBeforehand there will be the release of the first single called '\u00c9lan', which will be out on February 13th.

          "EXCITING NEWS!\nWe are proud to announce the release of our first single called '\u00c9lan', which will be out on February 13, 2015 via Nuclear Blast!\n\n\u201cOh, while I live to be the ruler of life, Not a slave\nTo meet life as a powerful conqueror, and nothing exterior to me will ever take command of me.\u201d\n\n- Walt Whitman\n\nCommented NIGHTWISH keyboardist and songwriter Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cThis beautiful quote from my hero Uncle Walt was the starting point for writing '\u00c9lan'. The underlying theme of the song is nothing less than the meaning of life, which can be something different for all of us. It\u00b4s important to surrender yourself to the occasional 'free fall' and not to fear the path less travelled by. '\u00c9lan' is a wonderful teaser for the full-length album, giving out a little taste, but revealing very little of the actual Journey of Grandeur to come\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2018\u00c9lan\u2019 tracklisting:\n\nCD:\n1. \u00c9lan (album version)\n2. \u00c9lan (radio edit)\n3. \u00c9lan (alternate version)\n4.

          "Eighth \u201cmaking-of\u201d album 2015 trailer (\u201cLondon\u201d) online!\n\n In this episode the band is visiting the rainy city of London to record the choir, orchestral parts and percussions for their new album at Angel Studios. Check it out here: http://youtu.be/r0ivbQz3IGI\n \nCommented NIGHTWISH keyboard player and main songwriter Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cThis must be the sixth or seventh time we\u2019re working with these people. We\u2019ve realized what they can do during these years. So it\u2019s really not a surprise anymore but it hasn\u2019t ceased to amaze me. The level of professionalism is just unbelievable. But even more importantly, they clearly like what they\u2019re doing. The guys we\u2019ve worked with for over 10 years are still up for it.\u201d \n \nAdded session-drummer Kai Hahto: \u201cThe professionalism is amazing. We were recording ethnic percussion yesterday. Some of the guys had played on Star Wars movies \u2013 and done Hans Zimmer soundtracks. I thought of myself as a humppa drummer. It was pretty amazing. They know their prima vista. You give them the notation, and they\u2019ll nail it in no time.\u201d\n \nNIGHTWISH also revealed the famed evolutionary biologist and atheist writer/leader Richard Dawkins as a guest on their eighth studio album.\n \nAdditionally the band announced their North American tour for April and May 2015.

And a strange insect on your hand. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. It\u2019s a wondrous place.\u201d\n\nAdded vocalist Floor Jansen: \u201cI am very sensitive about environment. Don\u2019t put me in the middle of a city and maybe super shiny, fantastic studio and keep me inspired for weeks. But a place like this does. I love nature and I love calm. We can work for hours and then you can relax.\u201d\n\nNIGHTWISH just recently announced their North American tour for April and May 2015.

The yet-untitled creation will be the first NIGHTWISH studio-record to feature Dutch vocalist Floor Jansen. Longtime drummer Jukka Nevalainen will sit out on the recording sessions due to health issues; Kai Hahto (WINTERSUN u.a.) will replace him. It\u2019s set for a release in spring 2015 via Nuclear Blast.\n \nToday the band put up the fourth album trailer, check it out here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJF4Twus_08\n \nCommented drummer Jukka Nevalainen on the first actual band rehearsal: \u201cYou have to remember that the last time we played together was about 11 months ago. It\u2019s been quite a while. So, all things considered out initial stabs were pretty OK.\u201d\nAdded guitarist Emppu Vuorinen: \u201cYou start to get into the songs when you rehearse them. We played a heavier tune, and it did get me moshing a bit. I don\u2019t know if it has something to do with age \u2013 but the need to show off has diminished even more. It\u2019s more like you want to do justice to the song and not strut your stuff.\u201d\n \nAlso check out:\n \nTrailer #1 \u2013 The Cabin:                                             www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB1IrA8FwrY \nTrailer #2 \u2013 By The Lake:                                          www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIhsFClj0U4\nTrailer #3 \u2013 Inside His Head:                                    www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ9PFUZ9uGs\nSpecial Clip #1: 'Planet Hell':                                   http://youtu.be/CRJ_csyXosU\nSpecial Clip #2: 'Last Of The Wilds':                         \nhttp://youtu.be/A-Djx6iZ70g\n \nYou can order the most current NIGHTWISH release, \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab, at this destination: http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISHShowtime\nor from the official Nightwish Shop at:                 http://shop.nightwish.com\nor via iTunes (live album incl. digital booklet):     http://georiot.co/2SNi\n \nwww.nightwish.com | www.facebook.com/nightwish | www.nuclearblast.de/nightwish\n  NIGHTWISH - Making of new album 2015; Episode 4 (OFFICIAL TRAILER) A NEW NIGHTWISH ALBUM IS COMING!

So far the bands\u2019 mastermind, keyboardist and visionary composer Tuomas Holopainen and sound engineer Tero \u201cTeeCee\u201d Kinnunen recorded demo version of 12 songs.\n\nCommented Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cFrom the moment I start writing the song, I have the story in my head.

And they should change!\u201d\n\nMore \u201cMaking of\u201d episodes to come, so keep your eyes peeled to the Nuclear Blast YouTube channel!\n\nYou can order the most current NIGHTWISH release, \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab, at this destination:  http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISHShowtime\nor from the official Nightwish Shop at:  http://shop.nightwish.com\nor via iTunes (live album incl. digital booklet):  http://georiot.co/2SNi\n\nwww.nightwish.com | www.facebook.com/nightwish | www.nuclearblast.de/nightwish\n\nNIGHTWISH \u2013 arbeiten an neuem Album, erster Trailer online!\n\nLehnt euch zur\u00fcck und schnallt euch fest an, denn heute geben NIGHTWISH einen ersten Einblick in ihr neues, bevorstehendes Album.
