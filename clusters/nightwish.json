We'd like to share more about the themes and the inspiration of the album in this twelfth \u201cmaking-of\u201d trailer!\nCheck it out here: http://youtu.be/3hSB4ENrQKc\n\nTuomas comments: \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of scientific approach to a lot of things on the album. Songs like \u2018Shudder Before The Beautiful\u2019, \u2018Endless Forms Most Beautiful\u2019, \u2018The Greatest Show On Earth\u2019 or \u2018Alpenglow\u2019 all somehow reflect the bliss of existence. It\u2019s temporary character. Evolution\u2026Maybe you could even talk about the poetic nature of science. Natural science and its paradigm \u2013 seem to represent something cold and boring to a lot of people. Hopefully we can illustrate with this album \u2013 that science can even be something profoundly spiritual.\u201d\n \nStand-in drummer Kai Hahto adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect theme to an album. Like, how did we come to be? And when our time here is done, what kind of mark do we leave? It\u2019s a pretty amazing theme.\u201d\n \nThe track list for \u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab reads as follows:\n \n01. Shudder Before The Beautiful\n02. Weak Fantasy\n03. \u00c9lan\n04. Yours Is An Empty Hope\n05. Our Decades In the Sun\n06. My Walden\n07. Endless Forms Most Beautiful\n08. Edema Ruh\n09. Alpenglow\n10. The Eyes Of Sharbat Gula\n11.

We set sail for the ultimate journey in March 2015, join us!\u201d, adds Tuomas Holopainen secretly. \n\nThe detailed cover-artwork was created by longtime collaborator Toxic Angel. \n\u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab features eleven new songs and will be released in different formats: \n\nStandard CD \nDigibook (incl. instrumental CD)\n2LP (vinyl in gatefold) in different colours \nEarbook (incl. instrumental and orchestral CD)\nEarbook (deluxe version incl. bonus vinyl)\nDownload \n\nPre-order your copy here: http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISH-Endless\n\nBeforehand there will be the release of the first single called '\u00c9lan', which will be out on February 13th.

The underlying theme of the song is nothing less than the meaning of life, which can be something different for all of us. It\u00b4s important to surrender yourself to the occasional 'free fall' and not to fear the path less travelled by. '\u00c9lan' is a wonderful teaser for the full-length album, giving out a little taste, but revealing very little of the actual Journey of Grandeur to come\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2018\u00c9lan\u2019 tracklisting:\n\nCD:\n1. \u00c9lan (album version)\n2. \u00c9lan (radio edit)\n3. \u00c9lan (alternate version)\n4.

Nightwish and Anette Olzon have decided to part company, in mutual understanding, for the good of all parties involved.\n\nIn recent times it has become increasingly obvious that the direction and the needs of the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover.\n\nNightwish has no intention of cancelling any upcoming shows, and as a result we have decided to bring in a substitute vocalist starting in Seattle 1.10.2012. Her name is Floor Jansen from The Netherlands (ex-After Forever, ReVamp), and she has graciously stepped in to help us complete the Imaginaerum world tour.\n\nWe are all strongly committed to this journey, this vehicle of spirit, and we are sure that this will lead to a brighter future for everyone.\n\nWe forever remain excited about the adventures to come, and we are extremely proud of the two beautiful albums and the wonderful shows we shared together.\n\n- NIGHTWISH & Anette Olzon",

          "Nightwish @ Costa de Fuego 2012\nKitee, Finlandia, 1996. Tuomas Holopainen comienza a pensar en formar un proyecto en solitario que tenga como punto de partida la creaci\u00f3n de atm\u00f3sferas. El guitarrista Erno \u2018Emppu\u2019 Vuorinen y la vocalista Tarja Turunen se unen a su idea y en unos meses ya tienen las primeras demos grabadas. Las guitarras ac\u00fasticas se tornan el\u00e9ctricas, entra Jukka Nevalainen a la bater\u00eda y \u2018Angels Fall First\u2019 (Spinefarm Records, 1997) se planta como su esperanzador debut. \u2018Oceanborn\u2019 (1998),  Wishmaster (2000) y Century Child (2002) les convierte en l\u00edderes de ventas en Finlandia (Discos de Platino y de Oro) y su \u00e9xito traspasa fronteras. Europa y Am\u00e9rica (del Norte y del Sur) se rinden a su sonido y comienzan a girar por todo el planeta en conciertos m\u00edticos inmortalizados en DVD. Tras tantos meses de convivencia, Tuomas se replantea la continuidad de la banda y decide cambiar la formaci\u00f3n dando entrada al bajista y vocalista Marco Hietala en lugar de Sami V\u00e4nsk\u00e4. \u2018Once\u2019 (2004) supuso un cambio de direcci\u00f3n conceptual, hacia un sonido m\u00e1s sinf\u00f3nico (con la Filarm\u00f3nica de Londres inclusive), transformando su \u00e9xito en consagraci\u00f3n con m\u00e1s de 130 conciertos en todo el mundo. Tarja Turunen es invitada a abandonar la nave y en su lugar llega la sueca Anette Olzon, tras un exhaustivo casting vocal internacional. \u2018Dark Passion Play\u2019 (2007) e \u2018Imaginaerum\u2019 (2011), que a\u00f1adir\u00eda una producci\u00f3n paralela de una pel\u00edcula hom\u00f3nima dirigida por Stobe Harju (responsable de su exitoso videoclip \u2018The Islander\u2019), son sus \u00faltimos trabajos. Siempre por delante, siempre innovando, siempre bienvenidos.\n+++\nPicture this; Kitee, Finland, 1996, Tuomas Holopainen imagines a solo project where the starting point will be creating atmospheres. Guitarist Erno 'Emppu' Vuorinen and vocalist Tarja Turunen join him and in a few months they record their first demos. Acoustic guitars become electric, Jukka Nevalainen comes in at the drums and 'Angels Fall First' (Spinefarm Records, 1997) is their hopeful debut. 'Oceanborn' (1998), Wishmaster (2000) and Century Child (2002) put them at the top of the sales charts in Finland (platinum and gold albums) and their success crosses borders. Europe and America (both North and South) surrender to their sound and they begin to tour the planet giving mythical performances immortalised on DVD. After many months on the road together, Tuomas questions the band's existe\u00acnce and decides to make changes in the line up, introducing bassist and vocalist Marco Hietala instead of Sami V\u00e4nsk\u00e4. 'Once' (2004) was a conceptual change towards a more symphonic sound (London Philharmonic included) which transformed their success into a worldwide phenomenon and brought along over 130 concerts. Tarja Turunen was invited to abandon ship and was replaced by Swedish Anette Olzon after an exhaustive international casting for a new vocalist. 'Dark Passion Play' (2007) and 'Imaginaerum' (2011) \u2013which includes the parallel production of a homonymous film directed by Stobe Harju (responsible for their acclaimed video 'The Islander')- are their latest works. Nightwish are always avant-garde, always innovating, always welcome.\n Nightwish - Storytime Nightwish's new single STORYTIME is available starting November 9th, 2011. It is the first single of the upcoming album IMAGINAERUM. Be sure to check http://...",

          "TUOMAS HOLOPAINEN \u2013 First details about the solo album \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge\u00ab\r\n\r\nTuomas has spent most of the year 2013 writing and producing his solo album. The whole album will be based on a graphic novel called \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge McDuck\u00ab, written and illustrated by Don Rosa.\r\n\r\nTuomas comments: \u201cThis is my longtime dream come true, 14 years in the making. And a homage to one of the best storytellers of our time. Thank you for sharing this celebration of Life & Adventure!\"\r\n\r\nThis 12 - chapter book tells the life story of a certain Scrooge, from his early years in the 19th century Scotland to his adventures all around the world until the 1950`s. The story contains such immense depth, detail, wit and emotional power, that the moment Tuomas read it nearly 20 years ago, it instantly became a story of profound personal interest and love for him. The initial spark of `coloring` this story with music, i.e. create a kind of \"soundtrack\" for the book, came to him already in 1999, and has ever since been haunting the back of his mind.\r\n\r\nThe album was written and produced by Tuomas Holopainen and will contain 10 songs, with total duration of approximately 60 minutes. The music will be of soundtrack / classical / folk genre in the vein of Vaughan Williams, Michael Nyman, James Newton Howard and Enya.\r\n\r\nMr. Pip Williams has done the orchestral arrangements, continuing his collaboration with Tuomas after the NIGHTWISH records \u00bbOnce\u00ab, \u00bbDark Passion Play\u00ab & \u00bbImaginaerum\u00ab.\r\n\r\nThere will be a number of guest musicians, including the London Orchestra, The Metro Voices (a choir from London) and four lead vocalists: Alan Reid, Johanna Kurkela, Johanna Iivanainen & Tony Kakko. Other guest appearances include Troy Donockley (uilleann pipes, low whistles, bodhran), Mikko Iivanainen (guitars & banjo), Teho Majam\u00e4ki (Didgeridoo), Jon Burr (Harmonica) and Dermot Crehan in the solo violin.\r\nThe recordings took place during August - October 2013, first at Angel Studios, London, then in various locations around Scotland and Finland.\r\n\r\nThe author of the book, Don Rosa, has done the artwork for the album.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a single release, from the track \u2018A Lifetime Of Adventure\u2019, and a music video to go with it in early 2014.\r\nThe album \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge\u00ab is scheduled for a release in April 2014.

          "Eighth \u201cmaking-of\u201d album 2015 trailer (\u201cLondon\u201d) online!\n\n In this episode the band is visiting the rainy city of London to record the choir, orchestral parts and percussions for their new album at Angel Studios. Check it out here: http://youtu.be/r0ivbQz3IGI\n \nCommented NIGHTWISH keyboard player and main songwriter Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cThis must be the sixth or seventh time we\u2019re working with these people. We\u2019ve realized what they can do during these years. So it\u2019s really not a surprise anymore but it hasn\u2019t ceased to amaze me. The level of professionalism is just unbelievable. But even more importantly, they clearly like what they\u2019re doing. The guys we\u2019ve worked with for over 10 years are still up for it.\u201d \n \nAdded session-drummer Kai Hahto: \u201cThe professionalism is amazing. We were recording ethnic percussion yesterday. Some of the guys had played on Star Wars movies \u2013 and done Hans Zimmer soundtracks. I thought of myself as a humppa drummer. It was pretty amazing. They know their prima vista. You give them the notation, and they\u2019ll nail it in no time.\u201d\n \nNIGHTWISH also revealed the famed evolutionary biologist and atheist writer/leader Richard Dawkins as a guest on their eighth studio album.\n \nAdditionally the band announced their North American tour for April and May 2015.

          "Get ready for the release of our seventh album trailer. In this episode we recap the summer and recording main parts of the new album at our summer camp. Check it out here: http://youtu.be/xPoVHMT2Gcc\n \nCommented keyboard player and main songwriter Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cWe are actually ahead of our schedule. Incredibly, Floor has sung about two songs a day. Marco cut the final bass parts in 1.5 days and Emppudid the rhythm guitars in a week. I think it was because everything was so well-rehearsed this time. We\u2019ve tried to work more like a band.\u201d\n \nAdded vocalist Floor Jansen: \u201cTuomas challenged me, using everything I have to offer. High, low, soft, whatever, but definitely lower stuff and very soft and intimate things. Something that more by coincidence was something that I kind of missed doing. Something I haven\u2019t explored much and Tuomas wrote parts where I have to use this completely, where I have to go into it entirely. I\u2019m very happy with what came out there.\u201d\n\nMore recent news:\nWe revealed the famed evolutionary biologist and atheist writer/leader Richard Dawkins as a guest on our eighth studio album.\n \nAnd we announced our North American tour for April and May 2015 together with Sabaton and Delain!

And a strange insect on your hand. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. It\u2019s a wondrous place.\u201d\n\nAdded vocalist Floor Jansen: \u201cI am very sensitive about environment. Don\u2019t put me in the middle of a city and maybe super shiny, fantastic studio and keep me inspired for weeks. But a place like this does. I love nature and I love calm. We can work for hours and then you can relax.\u201d\n\nNIGHTWISH just recently announced their North American tour for April and May 2015.

          "Fourth \u201cmaking-of\u201d album trailer (\u201cThe beginning of the Nightwish summer camp\u201d) online!\n\nNIGHTWISH are currently working on their new album with producer Tero \u201cTeeCee\u201d Kinnunen. The yet-untitled creation will be the first NIGHTWISH studio-record to feature Dutch vocalist Floor Jansen. Longtime drummer Jukka Nevalainen will sit out on the recording sessions due to health issues; Kai Hahto (WINTERSUN u.a.) will replace him. It\u2019s set for a release in spring 2015 via Nuclear Blast.\n \nToday the band put up the fourth album trailer, check it out here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJF4Twus_08\n \nCommented drummer Jukka Nevalainen on the first actual band rehearsal: \u201cYou have to remember that the last time we played together was about 11 months ago. It\u2019s been quite a while. So, all things considered out initial stabs were pretty OK.\u201d\nAdded guitarist Emppu Vuorinen: \u201cYou start to get into the songs when you rehearse them. We played a heavier tune, and it did get me moshing a bit. I don\u2019t know if it has something to do with age \u2013 but the need to show off has diminished even more. It\u2019s more like you want to do justice to the song and not strut your stuff.\u201d\n \nAlso check out:\n \nTrailer #1 \u2013 The Cabin:                                             www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB1IrA8FwrY \nTrailer #2 \u2013 By The Lake:                                          www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIhsFClj0U4\nTrailer #3 \u2013 Inside His Head:                                    www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ9PFUZ9uGs\nSpecial Clip #1: 'Planet Hell':                                   http://youtu.be/CRJ_csyXosU\nSpecial Clip #2: 'Last Of The Wilds':                         \nhttp://youtu.be/A-Djx6iZ70g\n \nYou can order the most current NIGHTWISH release, \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab, at this destination: http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISHShowtime\nor from the official Nightwish Shop at:                 http://shop.nightwish.com\nor via iTunes (live album incl. digital booklet):     http://georiot.co/2SNi\n \nwww.nightwish.com | www.facebook.com/nightwish | www.nuclearblast.de/nightwish\n  NIGHTWISH - Making of new album 2015; Episode 4 (OFFICIAL TRAILER) A NEW NIGHTWISH ALBUM IS COMING!

          "New album in the making, first trailer online!\n\nSit back and fasten your fairytale seatbelts, as of today NIGHTWISH reveal a first glimpse into their new album. The yet-untitled creation will be the first NIGHTWISH studio-record to feature Dutch vocalist Floor Jansen. It\u2019s set for a release in spring 2015 via Nuclear Blast.\n\nCheck out the first \u201cMaking of\u201d trailer here: http://youtu.be/BB1IrA8FwrY \n\nEnjoy the ride, as NIGHTWISH take you on a trip to where the magic happens: Settled right in the middle of the beautiful wintery landscape of Eno, Finland, band members and sound staff gather round the long table of \u201cthe Cabin\u201d to discuss every aspect, relevant for the making of NIGHTWISH album #8. So far the bands\u2019 mastermind, keyboardist and visionary composer Tuomas Holopainen and sound engineer Tero \u201cTeeCee\u201d Kinnunen recorded demo version of 12 songs.\n\nCommented Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cFrom the moment I start writing the song, I have the story in my head. I have a really clear vision how the songs should sound like at this point. Of course they will chance after band rehearsals and arranging. And they should change!\u201d\n\nMore \u201cMaking of\u201d episodes to come, so keep your eyes peeled to the Nuclear Blast YouTube channel!\n\nYou can order the most current NIGHTWISH release, \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab, at this destination:  http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISHShowtime\nor from the official Nightwish Shop at:  http://shop.nightwish.com\nor via iTunes (live album incl. digital booklet):  http://georiot.co/2SNi\n\nwww.nightwish.com | www.facebook.com/nightwish | www.nuclearblast.de/nightwish\n\nNIGHTWISH \u2013 arbeiten an neuem Album, erster Trailer online!\n\nLehnt euch zur\u00fcck und schnallt euch fest an, denn heute geben NIGHTWISH einen ersten Einblick in ihr neues, bevorstehendes Album. Das bisher noch unbetitelte Epos ist das erste NIGHTWISH Studioalbum, auf dem die niederl\u00e4ndische S\u00e4ngerin Floor Jansen vertreten ist. Erscheinen soll das Werk im Fr\u00fchjahr 2015 via Nuclear Blast.\n\nDen ersten \u201cMaking of\u201d Trailer k\u00f6nnt ihr hier sehen: http://youtu.be/BB1IrA8FwrY \n\nGenie\u00dft die Reise, denn NIGHTWISH nehmen euch mit an magischen Ort: Inmitten der wundervollen Winterlandschaft im finnischen Eno, versammeln sich Bandmitglieder und Soundt\u00fcftler, um alle Aspekte zu besprechen, die f\u00fcr die Entstehung des achten NIGHTWISH Longplayers relevant sind. Bisher hat Bandleader, Keyboarder und Kompositionsvision\u00e4r Tuomas Holopainen zusammen mit Toningenieur Tero \u201cTeeCee\u201d Kinnunen Demoversionen von 12 Songs aufgenommen. \n\nDazu Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cVon dem Moment an, wenn ich einen Song schreibe, habe ich die Geschichte dazu im Kopf. Ich habe eine klare Vorstellung davon, wie die Songs klingen sollen. Nat\u00fcrlich ver\u00e4ndern sich die Songs mit jeder Probe und jedem neuem Arrangement. Und so soll es auch sein!\u201c\n\nWeitere \u201cMaking of\u201d Folgen kommen bald, also haltet eure Augen auf und besucht regelm\u00e4\u00dfig den Nuclear Blast YouTube Kanal!\n\nDas aktuelleste NIGHTWISH Werk \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab, k\u00f6nnt ihr unter folgendem Link bestellen:                                                                        http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISHShowtime\nOder im Nightwish Shop:                                           http://shop.nightwish.com\nOder via iTunes (live album inkl. digital booklet):    http://georiot.co/2SNi\n\nwww.nightwish.com | www.facebook.com/nightwish | www.nuclearblast.de/nightwish Timeline Photos",

But while looking into the future we look back to the recording of this album in this 10th trailer.\nCheck it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YoyRFF3KY\nHere is a personal comment on this episode by Tuomas: \n\u201cThe writing process was extremely smooth and relatively easy. I had more fun than ever during the recordings. The R\u00f6sk\u00f6 summer camp was a lot of fun. The days were filled with friendship, hope and music. Obviously the sad thing was that Jukka had to step aside \u2013 but everything else has been really good.\u201d\nAnd Marco added: \u201cThe songs did grow during the process. We started out with Tuomas\u2019 computer demos and my own demos. We put them together \u2013 and started building the songs around those basic blocks. They really grew in depth and character along the way.\u201d\nWe recently revealed the track listing and different formats of \u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab which will be released as follows:\nJewelcase\n01.
