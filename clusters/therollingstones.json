I can\u2019t wait to get back on the stage!\u201d \u2013 Keith Richards\n\nThe Rolling Stones ZIP CODE tour will see Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood head back out on the road after their critically-acclaimed 14 ON FIRE tour in Asia, Europe, Australia and New Zealand in 2014. The iconic band will treat their generations of fans to special one night only shows, with a set packed full of classic Stones hits such as \u2018Gimme Shelter\u2019, \u2018Paint It Black\u2019, \u2018Jumpin\u2019 Jack Flash\u2019, \u2018Tumbling Dice\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s Only Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll\u2019, as well as special gems from their extraordinary catalogue.\n\nThe Rolling Stones ZIP CODE tour will be the first time the rock legends have played North American stadiums since 2005-2007\u2019s A Bigger Bang Tour.\n\nThe stage design for the stadium shows includes a thrust that extends deep into the audience allowing the Stones to interact directly with their fans. Known for their ground-breaking sets and use of cutting-edge technology, the Stones\u2019 set design will feature video screens and special effects that will enhance the high-octane experience of attending a live Stones\u2019 show.\n\nAEG Live\u2019s Concerts West is the promoter of The Rolling Stones ZIP CODE tour.\n\nThe tour will also coincide with the Rolling Stones re-release of Sticky Fingers on May 26 in North America, and May 25 in the rest of the world, by Universal Music. Sticky Fingers, one of the most revered albums from the Rolling Stones, is set to enthrall a new generation of fans in 2015. The 1971 classic features timeless tracks such as \u2018Brown Sugar,\u2019 \u2018Wild Horses,\u2019 \u2018Bitch\u2019 and \u2018Dead Flowers\u2019. Sticky Fingers 2015, with its iconic zip cover, will be unveiled in a variety of formats. The deluxe editions include a generous selection of previously unreleased Stones studio outtakes from the Sticky Fingers sessions and stunning live performances from that time. These sought after tracks have never been available until this release.\n\nRecorded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama and Olympic Studios in London, and produced by regular confidant Jimmy Miller, Sticky Fingers was released just before the Stones became tax exiles in the south of France, leaving Britain after a sensational farewell tour. It also featured some of the most ground breaking design in rock history, with its famous working zip on the front cover and artwork by Andy Warhol.\n\nTHE ROLLING STONES \u2013 ZIP CODE TOUR\n\nMay 24, 2015                       San Diego, CA                       Petco Park\n\nMay 30, 2015                       Columbus, OH                     Ohio Stadium\n\nJune 3, 2015                         Minneapolis, MN              TCF Bank Stadium\n\nJune 6, 2015                         Dallas, TX                               AT&T Stadium\n\nJune 9, 2015                         Atlanta, GA                            Bobby Dodd Stadium\n\nJune 12, 2015                      Orlando, FL                            Orlando Citrus Bowl\n\nJune 17, 2015                      Nashville, TN                        LP Field\n\nJune 20, 2015                      Pittsburgh, PA                     Heinz Field\n\nJune 23, 2015                      Milwaukee, WI                   Summerfest / Marcus Amphitheater\n\nJune 27, 2015                      Kansas City, MO                 Arrowhead Stadium\n\nJuly 1, 2015                           Raleigh, NC                            Carter-Finley Stadium\n\nJuly 4, 2015                           Indianapolis, IN                                   Indianapolis Motor Speedway\n\nJuly 8, 2015                           Detroit, MI                             Comerica Park\n\nJuly 11, 2015                        Buffalo, NY                             Ralph Wilson Stadium\n\nJuly 15, 2015                        Quebec, QC                           Le Festival D\u2019\u00c9t\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec*\n\n*wristbands will go on sale at 12pm local on Saturday, April 11 Timeline Photos",

          "The Rolling Stones have released their second official bootleg album, Hampton Coliseum (Live 1981) through StonesArchiveStore.com. Following the success of their first official bootleg The Brussels Affair in November, the band have now released the notorious, and oft bootlegged show recorded in Virginia on 18th December 1981.\n\nRemixed by long-time Stones collaborator Bob Clearmountain, who was involved in the original recording of the concert, the album is available as a FLAC or MP3 from StonesArchiveStore.com for fans around the world, and from Google Android for fans in the USA as an MP3 http://tinyurl.com/73ael5g.\n\nThe concert took place on Keith\u2019s 38th birthday on the same night the concert was filmed for pay-per-view television. The concert achieved notoriety in the history of the band when a fan invaded the stage during (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction heading towards Mick, and Keith intervened hitting the intruder with his Fender Telecaster.\n\nThe line-up for the concert was Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Ronnie Wood, Bill Wyman and Ian \"Stu\" Stewart, along with Ian McLagan and Ernie Watts.\n\nThe complete track list is:\nUnder My Thumb\nWhen The Whip Comes Down\nLet's Spend The Night Together\nShattered\nNeighbours\nBlack Limousine\nJust My Imagination\nTwenty Flight Rock\nGoing To A Go Go\nLet Me Go\nTime Is On My Side\nBeast Of Burden\nWaiting On A Friend\nLet It Bleed\nYou Can't Always Get What You Want\nBand Introductions and Happy Birthday Keith\nLittle T&A\nTumbling Dice\nShe's So Cold\nHang Fire\nMiss You\nHonky Tonk Women\nBrown Sugar\nStart Me Up\nJumping Jack Flash\n(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\n Stones Archive Stones Archive Music, Downloadable Music, Clothing, Shirts, mp3s, Videos, DVDs, CDs, Gift Certificates, Gift Cards, Hats",

Maybe you filmed us on Super 8, stepping off the Isle of Wight ferry in 1964? Or perhaps you have made a VHS recording of us hanging out backstage at MSG in 1981? Do you have a recording from our gig in Streatham in 1963?\n\nIf you think you may have an amazing memento from our history we'd love to hear from you.
