          "12 de Marzo de 1956.\nNace Steve Harris (cuyo nombre verdadero es Stephen Percy Harris), en Leytonstone, Londres, Inglaterra.\nEs el fundador, bajista, teclista, compositor principal, y l\u00edder de la banda m\u00e1s grande de heavy metal de \u00e9ste planeta: IRON MAIDEN.\nFund\u00f3 Maiden en el a\u00f1o 1975 junto a Dave Murray, es el \u00fanico miembro de la banda que ha grabado en todos los discos a lo largo de los casi cuarenta a\u00f1os de carrera de la banda.\nEs un gran aficionado al f\u00fatbol y fan\u00e1tico del West Ham United, sin embargo, dej\u00f3 todo para formar Iron Maiden. Hasta el d\u00eda de hoy practica el deporte durante las giras de la banda, con la cual incluso tiene un equipo, el Iron Maiden FC.\nBajista autodidacta, su primer bajo fu\u00e9 una copia de un Fender Telecaster Bass y lo obtuvo el a\u00f1o 1971 por el precio de 40 libras esterlinas. Hace unos cuantos a\u00f1os Fender dise\u00f1\u00f3 con \u00e9l un bajo con su firma.\nHarris ha sido influenciado fuertemente como m\u00fasico, sobre todo por los bajistas de hard rock de fines de los 60s y principo de los 70s siendo los principales: Rinus Gerritsen de Golden Earring, Mel Schacher de Grand Funk Railroad, Chris Squire de Yes, Mike Rutherford de Genesis, Geezer Butler de Black Sabbath, John Entwistle de The Who; John Paul Jones de Led Zeppelin, Greg Lake de Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Roger Glover de Deep Purple, Glenn Cornick de Jethro Tull (una de sus bandas favoritas).\nPero uno de los bajistas realmente preferidos de Steve Harris fue Pete Way, de UFO, quien influy\u00f3 fuertemente en el estilo de ejecuci\u00f3n de Harris y tambi\u00e9n como persona y m\u00fasico en general; es m\u00e1s Maiden versiona un tema de Ufo.\nEl nombre de Iron Maiden, lo tom\u00f3 a partir de un instrumento de tortura medieval llamado \"doncella de hierro\" (Iron Maiden) que aparec\u00eda en una pel\u00edcula antigua llamada \"The Man With the Iron Mask\".\nEn febrero de 2013, Harris lanz\u00f3 su \u00e1lbum debut como solista, British Lion. El cual lo llevo a realizar una mini gira de 24 fechas por Europa.\nSteve Harris com\u00fanmente utiliza un bajo de cuatro cuerdas. \u00c9l comenta que s\u00f3lo usa ese tipo de bajo porque considera que con \u00e9l produce el sonido tradicional de Iron Maiden.\nSteve Harris es considerado por muchos uno de los mejores y extraordinarios bajistas en la historia del rock y del heavy, tanto por su aguerrido y particular estilo sobre el escenario, como por su calidad como compositor.\nSu estilo tocando el bajo es muy amplio y variado: desde sus famosos galopes alternando los dedos \u00edndices y coraz\u00f3n, hasta la ejecuci\u00f3n de powerchords, adem\u00e1s de riff complejos y mel\u00f3dicos en muchos temas considerados cl\u00e1sicos de Iron Maiden. \nHarris asegura que no realiza ejercicios de calentamiento antes de tocar.\nEn la composici\u00f3n, a la hora de escribir las letras suele tomar como fuente de inspiraci\u00f3n la Historia, la mitolog\u00eda o pel\u00edculas.\nEn la actualidad el nuevo \u00e1lbum de los Maiden est\u00e1 listo y s\u00f3lo se espera la recuperaci\u00f3n vocal de su cantante para lanzarlo e iniciar la nueva gira mundial que todos estamos esperando.\nFeliz Cumplea\u00f1os maestrazo...!",

Dezember 1994: In Bosnien und Herzegowina wird immer noch unerbittlich gek\u00e4mpft, und Sarajevo befindet sich inmitten der l\u00e4ngsten Belagerung der j\u00fcngeren Geschichte. F\u00fcr Bruce Dickinson, den legend\u00e4ren S\u00e4nger der Heavy-Metal-Band Iron Maiden, Grund genug, gemeinsam mit den Jungs seines Solo-Projekts eine gef\u00e4hrliche Busreise auf sich zu nehmen, um der musikbegeisterten Jugend der Stadt ein paar Stunden Abwechslung vom strapazi\u00f6sen Leben in der umk\u00e4mpften Stadt zu bieten. Der Regisseur Tarik Hodzic erinnert mit seiner authentischen und packenden Doku an dieses Konzert mitten im Krieg und daran, was dieser unvergessliche Gig f\u00fcr die Menschen in Sarajevo, aber auch f\u00fcr Dickinson und seine Truppe bedeutet hat. \n_______________________\n\nScream for me Sarajevo \ud83c\udfbc\ud83c\udfa4 \ud83c\udfac\n#LETSCEE2017\n\n14 December 1994: Bosnia and Herzegovina is still a huge and unrelenting battlefield and the capital city is under the longest siege in recent history. Reason enough for Bruce Dickinson, the legendary frontman of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden, to go on a dangerous bus trip with the lads of his solo project and offer the music mad youth of Sarajevo a diversion from the gruelling life in an embattled city. Director Tarik Hodzic reminds us of the successful concert and of its value to the audience back then, and how it still matters to Dickinson and his crew today.

          "EMI Music are proud to announce the release of Iron Maiden founder Steve Harris\u2019 debut solo/side project album. Entitled \u2018British Lion\u2019 and comprising ten songs that Steve and his collaborators have been working on for the past few years between Iron Maiden tours and releases, it is an album that will surprise and delight music fans the world over.\r\n\r\nWith a decidedly heavy rock-vibe this roaring debut paints with a full palette of sounds; brooding, melancholic, righteously indignant and exuberantly heavy. With Kevin Shirley at the mixing helm \u2013 whose credits include Iron Maiden as well as Led Zeppelin, Journey and Rush among many others \u2013 this is an album to sink your teeth into.\r\n\r\nFrom the growling riffage of opening salvo This Is My God to the heavy forlorn balladry of follow-up Lost Worlds which showcases Richard Taylor\u2019s soaring vocals, it\u2019s clear that \u2018British Lion\u2019 is an altogether different beast from Maiden.\r\n\r\nKarma Killer, with its dirge-like muscularity, and Us Against The World, with its massive chorus, demonstrates just how far \u2018British Lion\u2019 has flexed Steve Harris\u2019 considerable musical muscle. Dovetailed with guitarist David Hawkins\u2019 positively gargantuan lyrical guitar melodies, it\u2019s a mere hors d'oeuvre ahead of the epic, riffing-feast of The Chosen Ones, with its swaggering bravado.\r\n\r\nA World Without Heaven, at a breathtaking seven minutes and infused with progressive elements without ever teetering into self-indulgence illustrates perfectly these songsmiths\u2019 colossal abilities to create a mood and stay there. Supercharged by Steve Harris\u2019 inimitable style, there\u2019s an un-cynical vibe here that\u2019s as refreshing as it is out of place in today\u2019s all-too-categorised music industry.\r\n\r\nAnd as far as the name \u2018British Lion\u2019; \u201cI\u2019ve always been proud to be British,\u201d explains Steve, \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why I shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s a massive part of being me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m flag-waving or trying to preach, this is not a political statement at all. It\u2019s like supporting your football team, where you come from. I just think it lends itself to some really strong imagery too, and to me it fits in with the sound.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith Iron Maiden, Steve Harris has become one of the most recognised and successful ambassadors for British music on the world stage. Having released 15 studio albums, sold over 85 million records worldwide and played more than two thousand gigs in 58 countries in the band\u2019s thirty-five year career, his appeal is truly global. \r\n\r\nAnd now with \u2018British Lion\u2019, Steve steps out from Iron Maiden\u2019s illustrious shadow to present a different side of his musical visions.\r\n\r\nThe tracklisting for \u2018British Lion\u2019 is as follows:\r\n\r\n1.This Is My God\r\n2.Lost Worlds\r\n3.Karma Killer\r\n4.Us Against The World\r\n5.The Chosen Ones\r\n6.A World Without Heaven\r\n7.Judas\r\n8.Eyes Of The Young\r\n9.These Are The Hands\r\n10.The Lesson Timeline Photos",

          "ED FORCE ONE ONWARDS AND UPWARDS AGAIN\n\nMAIDEN PLANE SET TO REJOIN THE BOOK OF SOULS TOUR IN BRASILIA TOMORROW AFTER MASSIVE REPAIRS COMPLETED IN JUST 10 DAYS \n\nTWO 5000kg, FOUR MILLION DOLLAR JET ENGINES FLOWN 12,000 KM TO REPLACE DAMAGED ENGINES\n\nFollowing the major accident in Chile (link to previous release on this) on the morning of Saturday March 12, we are delighted to announce that a fully repaired Ed Force One will take off tomorrow afternoon, Tuesday March 22, from Santiago Airport to rejoin the tour at Bras\u00edlia Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport. Following the show at Nilsen Nelson Arena, the plane will be loaded up once again on Wednesday with over 20 tons of equipment and our tour personnel to fly to Fortaleza for the concert on Thursday and on from there to Sao Paulo then New York and onwards round the World on The Book of Souls World Tour which visits 36 countries in the five month period. \n\nThe accident required the replacing of both of  the Boeing 747\u2019s  port side jet engines, a tough proposition at the best of times but not made any easier by the fact of the distances involved in getting such huge components, parts, tools and technical crew to Chile as quickly as possible to get Ed Force One back in the air. The engines alone weigh 5000kg each, and cost around four million dollars each.\n\nEd Force One is leased from Air Atlanta who went into immediate action following the incident, with technical assistance from Boeing. An emergency meeting on the Sunday was called to create a comprehensive detailed plan for this complex operation \u2013 locating suitable engines, thrust reversers, cowlings and parts, working out necessary tooling and technical team, logistics of ground and freight transport and tech team travel and a myriad of other detail. All from scratch. The next couple of days were spent putting these plans meticulously into place\n\nThe result was that on Thursday last, March 17, a Cargolux chartered 747 freighter left Luxembourg carrying two huge replacement jet engines, trucked there from Hannover, Germany. The Charter stopped over at Stansted Airport, Essex, UK to collect two more consignments. Cowlings and thrust reversers were trucked there in huge boxes from Kemble, UK, along with tooling and consumables flown in specially from Jeddah to Heathrow and hauled to Stansted. \n\nThe chartered 747 then completed the 12,000km (7410 miles)  flight to Santiago , arriving at 9am Friday morning. The technicians were flown there from Iceland and from Atlanta Air\u2019s base in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, six in total, to join with EF1\u2019s own two onboard techs, Bjorn Bjarnason and Sigurbjarni ( Barney) Thormundsson, and Jeremy Smith of Rock It Cargo Ltd, who is on tour with us supervising the freight and customs aspects.\n\nThe engines were cleared by Chilean Customs Friday lunchtime and they were transferred to the LAN Chile maintenance area of the airport arriving just before 2pm.  Working in shifts 24 hours a day the techs were then able to start removing Engine number 1 and then on Saturday Engine number 2.  Using hoists and cranes the damaged engines had to be detached then lowered into a cradle in order to swap with the new replacement engines.  The replacement engines were then lifted up and into a place.  Once the support pylons had been inspected and x-rayed and damage assessed, both of which passed with flying colours, then the new engines were attached with, as one of the techs said, a \u201c million\u201d wires.  Both were finally in place and attached by Sunday lunchtime and then the thrust reversers fitted overnight, almost as complex an operation as fitting the actual engines due to being right under the wing. Final piece of the jigsaw was for the Eddie decals to be fitted and then both engines tested by running to full power.\n\nComments Bruce Dickinson, Maiden vocalist and pilot of Ed Force One : \u201cThe speed and thoroughness of this incredibly complex operation was stunning and we are so very pleased to get our plane back! We would like to thank Air Atlanta and their terrific rescue team for a fantastic effort in achieving this in the time they did, and to Boeing, LAN Chile. ACS and Rock It Cargo for all their invaluable support.  We are sorry though for our fans in Cordoba, Buenos Aires, Rio and Belo Horizonte who missed out seeing the plane, but we hope they enjoyed the concerts as much as we did.\n\nWe should also thank our Killer Krew who found themselves at lunchtime on the Saturday of the accident with over 20 tons of equipment at the airport in Santiago and over 60 people all to get to Cordoba for early the next day to set up the huge show we are carrying. The distance is \u201conly\u201d 1000km, but with a small matter of the Andes in between! They did it , by the skin of the teeth, and all went very well for the show in Cordoba and the other cities EF1 just missed. It\u2019s quite a feat of logistics to  find and put into action at such short notice all the transport, replacement air-charters, schedule flights etcetera to enable us to play those next four shows on time without EF1, our transport for everything. Great effort, team, many thanks from all of us. And to our promoter MOVE and ACS for all their assistance and time with this too\u201c Photos from Iron Maiden's post",

We expect no disruption to the tour in any way and are looking for a replacement 747 Ed Force One while our current beauty is healed. More news on that later. Until then, believe me, we will get to you all on this tour one way or another wherever you are.\n\nWe are also delighted to say that we have been officially informed that the two Chilean airport staff who were injured following the malfunction of the tow truck connecting bolt will make a complete recovery. Best wishes to them and their families.\n\nUp the Irons!  See you soon. And thanks Chile, what an amazing reaction and show!!\n\n- Rod Timeline Photos",

          "ED FORCE ONE BADLY DAMAGED ON THE GROUND IN COMODORO ARTURO MERINO BENITEZ (SANTIAGO, CHILE) AIRPORT\n\nCONCERTS IN ARGENTINA TOMORROW AND TUESDAY EXPECTED TO GO AHEAD AS PLANNED\n \nEd Force One was this morning tethered to a tow truck to be taken for refuelling prior to flying  over the Andes to Cordoba for the next show. On moving  the steering pin that is part of the mechanism that connects the ground tug to the aircraft  seemingly fell out. On making a turn the aircraft had no steering and collided with the ground tug badly damaging the undercarriage, two of the aircrafts engines and  injuring two ground tug operators, both of whom have been taken to hospital. We hope of course that they make a full and speedy recovery and we will be closely monitoring their progress. The flight engineers are on site and evaluating the damage, but their initial report is that the engines have suffered large damage and will require an extended period of maintenance and possibly two new engines.\n \nWe are currently making contingency arrangements to get to the show in Cordoba tomorrow with band, crew and equipment intact. Fortunately the 20 tons of equipment had not been loaded onto EF1 at the time of the accident. Although this is tragic for our beautiful plane we do not expect this to affect our concert schedule including the next 2 shows in Cordoba and Buenos Aires. And we hope to find a new Ed Force One to continue this adventure with us in the near future. We will keep everyone updated when we know more, so keep checking only on this site for official news.\n \nTo finish on a high note however, our visit to Chile was a huge success with 58,000 fans coming to the show as totally brilliant as ever in the Stadium Nacional last night.

The band have been locked away in rehearsals for the past few weeks working on the new set-list and report that everything is going exceptionally well and they are raring to get started.\n\nEd Force One, our new 747 Jumbo, is all decaled or branded-up ready to go and Bruce has his shiny new 747 type rating so he can fly the plane. Ed Force One flies into the UK on Wednesday evening and IronMaiden.com will be at Cardiff Airport, stepladder and phone in hand, to bring you the first footage live on Periscope! Keep an eye on the website or our social media channels for details - we\u2019re @ironmaiden on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nAs we initially announced we\u2019ll be using Ed Force One right around the world as usual but also including the first few shows in Europe this time, making this the first time EF1 has visited Europe on tour!. However after the Swedish show at Gothenburg Ullvei Stadium on June 17 we\u2019ll be reverting to our traditional truck & bus touring methods as logistically this makes much more sense considering the lesser distances involved and airport parameters.\n\nJust to remind you, although many of the shows are already sold out, particularly in North America , there are always likely to be some production-hold tickets released to the public closer to show day. So if you do find a venue is sold out it\u2019s always worth checking with them again, probably from around 3 days in advance of any show, right up to show day itself, in case these held tickets are being released for sale. Also for fans in North America interested in the Trooper Pre-Party Upgrade kindly note that Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas and New York are already sold out and other cities going quickly, so if you are interested... http://ironmaiden.future-beat.com/artist.cfm?id=3364\n\nMore news soon from Cardiff!
