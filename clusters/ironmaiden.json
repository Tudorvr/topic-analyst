          "Parlophone Records (BMG/INgrooves Music Group for the USA) will follow the 2012/13 IRON MAIDEN vinyl picture disc reissues of the first eight Iron Maiden albums, which spanned the 1980s, with brand new pressings of the albums in heavyweight 180g black vinyl.\n\nIn conjunction with these premium album releases, a strictly limited one-off run of the 7\u201d singles from each respective album will be made available. These highly collectable black vinyl singles will be cut from the original analogue master tapes. Released in replica artwork packaging, they are sure to become a must-have item for fans, collectors and anyone who missed out first time round.\n\nThe albums will also be cut from the original analogue master tapes and packaged in identical artwork to the initial 1980\u2019s releases.  As a bonus, the first batch of album releases (Iron Maiden/Killers/The Number Of The Beast) will also be made available in a Collector\u2019s Box sized to house all 8 albums. This package will be a strictly limited edition and available while stocks last.\n\nThe records will be released chronologically across a two month period starting October 13th (14th USA) with the first 3 albums (Iron Maiden/Killers/The Number Of The Beast) and the seven corresponding 7\u201d singles:\n\nRunning Free b/w Burning Ambition\nSanctuary b/w Drifter (Live) and I\u2019ve Got The Fire (Live)\nWomen In Uniform b/w Invasion\nTwilight Zone/Wrathchild double A side\nPurgatory b/w Genghis Khan\nRun To The Hills  b/w Total Eclipse\nThe Number Of The Beast b/w Remember Tomorrow (Live)\n\nFollowed by:\n\nOctober 27th (28th USA): Piece Of Mind, Powerslave and Live After Death and the six corresponding 7\u201d singles:\n\nFlight Of Icarus b/w I\u2019ve Got The Fire\nThe Trooper b/w Cross-Eyed Mary\n2 Minutes To Midnight b/w Rainbow\u2019s Gold\nAces High b/w King Of Twilight\nRunning Free (Live) b/w Sanctuary (Live)\nRun To The Hills (Live) b/w Phantom Of The Opera (Live)\n\nNovember 24th (25th USA): Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son and the six corresponding 7\u201d singles:\n\nWasted Years  b/w Reach Out\nStranger In A Strange Land b/w That Girl\nCan I Play With Madness b/w Black Bart Blues\nThe Evil That Men Do b/w Prowler \u201888\nThe Clairvoyant  b/w The Prisoner (Live)\nInfinite Dreams (Live) b/w Killers (Live)\n\nThe release of these high quality, black vinyl records offers optimum choice to fans who would like to own a piece of Maiden\u2019s authentic 1980\u2019s vinyl sound, or for those simply wanting to rediscover this much loved, iconic format. Coupled with the end of the Maiden England World Tour which began in North America in 2012 and finished last month at Knebworth Park\u2019s Sonisphere Festival, this now completes Maiden\u2019s 1980\u2019s touring and catalogue reissues cycle, so the band are free to focus on their dynamic future plans.

Hasta el d\u00eda de hoy practica el deporte durante las giras de la banda, con la cual incluso tiene un equipo, el Iron Maiden FC.\nBajista autodidacta, su primer bajo fu\u00e9 una copia de un Fender Telecaster Bass y lo obtuvo el a\u00f1o 1971 por el precio de 40 libras esterlinas. Hace unos cuantos a\u00f1os Fender dise\u00f1\u00f3 con \u00e9l un bajo con su firma.\nHarris ha sido influenciado fuertemente como m\u00fasico, sobre todo por los bajistas de hard rock de fines de los 60s y principo de los 70s siendo los principales: Rinus Gerritsen de Golden Earring, Mel Schacher de Grand Funk Railroad, Chris Squire de Yes, Mike Rutherford de Genesis, Geezer Butler de Black Sabbath, John Entwistle de The Who; John Paul Jones de Led Zeppelin, Greg Lake de Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Roger Glover de Deep Purple, Glenn Cornick de Jethro Tull (una de sus bandas favoritas).\nPero uno de los bajistas realmente preferidos de Steve Harris fue Pete Way, de UFO, quien influy\u00f3 fuertemente en el estilo de ejecuci\u00f3n de Harris y tambi\u00e9n como persona y m\u00fasico en general; es m\u00e1s Maiden versiona un tema de Ufo.\nEl nombre de Iron Maiden, lo tom\u00f3 a partir de un instrumento de tortura medieval llamado \"doncella de hierro\" (Iron Maiden) que aparec\u00eda en una pel\u00edcula antigua llamada \"The Man With the Iron Mask\".\nEn febrero de 2013, Harris lanz\u00f3 su \u00e1lbum debut como solista, British Lion. El cual lo llevo a realizar una mini gira de 24 fechas por Europa.\nSteve Harris com\u00fanmente utiliza un bajo de cuatro cuerdas. \u00c9l comenta que s\u00f3lo usa ese tipo de bajo porque considera que con \u00e9l produce el sonido tradicional de Iron Maiden.\nSteve Harris es considerado por muchos uno de los mejores y extraordinarios bajistas en la historia del rock y del heavy, tanto por su aguerrido y particular estilo sobre el escenario, como por su calidad como compositor.\nSu estilo tocando el bajo es muy amplio y variado: desde sus famosos galopes alternando los dedos \u00edndices y coraz\u00f3n, hasta la ejecuci\u00f3n de powerchords, adem\u00e1s de riff complejos y mel\u00f3dicos en muchos temas considerados cl\u00e1sicos de Iron Maiden. \nHarris asegura que no realiza ejercicios de calentamiento antes de tocar.\nEn la composici\u00f3n, a la hora de escribir las letras suele tomar como fuente de inspiraci\u00f3n la Historia, la mitolog\u00eda o pel\u00edculas.\nEn la actualidad el nuevo \u00e1lbum de los Maiden est\u00e1 listo y s\u00f3lo se espera la recuperaci\u00f3n vocal de su cantante para lanzarlo e iniciar la nueva gira mundial que todos estamos esperando.\nFeliz Cumplea\u00f1os maestrazo...!",

Clive was a very old friend of all of us. He was a wonderful person and an amazing drummer who made a valuable contribution to Maiden in the early days when we were starting out. This is a sad day for everyone in the band and those around him and our thoughts and condolences are with his partner Mimi and family at this time.\"\r\n \r\nBruce Dickinson adds \u201cI first met Clive when he was leaving Samson and joining Iron Maiden.

This is a terribly sad day and all our thoughts are with Mimi and the family\u201d\r\n \r\nAs Maiden fans all know, Clive joined Maiden in 1979 and performed on the first three albums Iron Maiden (1980), Killers (1981) and The Number Of The Beast (1982).\r\nPrior to that he was a member of Samson, the band Bruce fronted before he too joined Maiden.

Now available for the very first time on DVD, this live show was filmed across two sold-out nights at Birmingham N.E.C Arena, UK in November 1988 during the band\u2019s \u201cSeventh Son Of A Seventh Son World Tour\u201d. Disc one contains the concert which has been specially upgraded and extended from the existing 1989 longform VHS release and now includes three previously unreleased encores: Running Free, Run To The Hills and Sanctuary thereby completing the full concert with a total running time of 110 minutes . Maiden\u2019s own Film Producer and Director Andy Matthews went back to the 1988 edit and painstakingly remastered each shot digitally; colour correcting and grading to give the image the best possible look from that time.  As well as the VHS stereo sound track by Martin Birch, the band\u2019s producer between 1981 and 1993, the DVD also includes a brand new 5.1 audio surround mix by Maiden\u2019s current producer Kevin Shirley. The concert was meticulously directed and edited by bass player and founder member Steve Harris, so as to capture the performance from a fans-eye view of the stage, focusing fully on the music, the elaborate stage production and the lighting.  Add into the mix an electrifying set list and of course Eddie, and Maiden England now offers a snapshot of a bygone era in which the band, as they continue to do today, devote their all in delivering the ultimate live experience for their fans.\r\n\r\nDisc two is an extensive bonus disc featuring an exclusive documentary charting Part 3 in the History of Iron Maiden. This 40-minute film comprises recent interviews with the five band members and manager, Rod Smallwood. Picking up the story in the aftermath of the \u201884/85 World Slavery tour, this interesting and insightful documentary sees the band speak candidly about their memories of an exciting and occasionally turbulent period from which would emerge the albums Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. As the Eighties began to draw to a close, so did another chapter in Maiden\u2019s compelling history.\r\n\r\nOther special extras on the bonus disc include Twelve Wasted Years. First released as a longform VHS in 1987 and available for the first time on DVD, this documentary runs for 90 minutes and includes archive interviews and dynamic live footage from the band\u2019s beginnings in the now legendary Ruskin Arms pub, via London\u2019s Marquee club and three World Tours. Five promo videos for the singles from the aforementioned albums are also featured and have been carefully restored and improved upon from the original films using the very latest software with the audio remastered in digital stereo. \r\n\r\nManager Rod Smallwood comments \u201cWe've been busy upgrading this concert footage for a long time, with our in-house Film Producer and Director Andy Matthews working tirelessly to weave his magic yet again!. The 1989 VHS video has been largely unavailable for many years and we know how eagerly our fans have been awaiting the new version so we wanted to give it the best possible treatment. The current Maiden England World Tour which continues later this year revisits much of the set list and production from the initial 1989 VHS release so it will be interesting to compare just how much has changed in terms of our 2013 live show production, especially with all the advances in modern technology and the improvements we've been able to make to the set\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Maiden England \u201888 concert soundtrack will also be made available on 2CD album, Limited Edition double vinyl picture disc and Digital Download formats. The audio had previously only ever been available before on CD as part of EMI\u2019s 1994 Sound And Vision Series packaged alongside the VHS, but with two tracks fewer than the video contained. Can I Play With Madness and Hallowed Be Thy Name were not featured as there was no space on the 1CD disc. Now with the three encores also included the double disc offers a total of 5 tracks previously unavailable on CD making this the first full and complete audio recording release of this historic tour.\r\n\r\nDISC ONE \u2013 MAIDEN ENGLAND \u201988      \r\nSet List \u2013\r\nMoonchild\r\nThe Evil That Men Do\r\nThe Prisoner\r\nStill Life\r\nDie With Your Boots On\r\nInfinite Dreams\r\nKillers\r\nCan I Play With Madness\r\nHeaven Can Wait\r\nWasted Years\r\nThe Clairvoyant\r\nSeventh Son Of A Seventh Son\r\nThe Number Of The Beast\r\nHallowed Be Thy Name\r\nIron Maiden\r\nRun To The Hills*\r\nRunning Free*\r\nSanctuary*\r\n\r\n*previously unreleased.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISC TWO \u2013 THE HISTORY OF IRON MAIDEN PART 3\r\nThe History Of Iron Maiden - Part 3         \r\n12 Wasted Years                                   \r\nWasted Years promo video                   \r\nStranger In A Strange Land promo video \r\nCan I Play With Madness promo video   \r\nThe Evil That Men Do promo video\r\nThe Clairvoyant promo video Timeline Photos",

          "Steve Harris will be taking his new solo/side project British Lion out on the road next month visiting fourteen countries and twenty four cities across Europe, starting in Portugal on Feb 21. For the first time ever, and as a major surprise to many, Iron Maiden\u2019s bass player, founder member and leader will be taking temporary leave from his Maiden activities and heading out on a full European Club tour. \r\n\r\nSteve comments \u201cI love touring and live shows and I\u2019m very excited about touring with British Lion. It\u2019s fantastic to get out there and once again experience the sheer vibrancy of small clubs with the fans right up front and in your face. I think the fans will enjoy that too. It\u2019s exciting, going back to the roots, and it\u2019s going to be fantastic. We are taking this to clubs all round Europe - a full club tour, with club shows at club prices, hot, sweaty and loud . We have no idea how many people will turn out to see us as it\u2019s obviously very recent and very new, so we have kept the venues small with tickets priced accordingly as low as we reasonably could. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve known all the guys in the band for ages and, besides being great musicians, they are also good friends, which is lucky because this has been an ongoing project for many years! They\u2019ve had to be very patient with me as, of course, I\u2019m so involved with Maiden I don\u2019t really get a lot of free time to work on other stuff. So it\u2019s great to finally have the opportunity to get out and do all these shows. The reaction to the album has been really good and I think it will sound great live. We\u2019re all planning to have a lot of fun on this tour!\u201d\r\n\r\nBritish Lion is Steve\u2019s debut CD outside Iron Maiden and was released by EMI in September 2012. Featured alongside Steve are Richard Taylor on vocals, David Hawkins on guitar and keys, Grahame Leslie on guitar, and Simon Dawson on drums. The 10 track album was mixed by Kevin Shirley [Maiden\u2019s longstanding producer] and has been pronounced both \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201ca big hearted ferocious triumph\u201d by the music press who also commented that although it\u2019s stamped with Steve\u2019s inimitable style, it\u2019s also very different to Maiden, so fans will be in for a whole new experience seeing and hearing these new songs played live.

          "EMI Music are proud to announce the release of Iron Maiden founder Steve Harris\u2019 debut solo/side project album. Entitled \u2018British Lion\u2019 and comprising ten songs that Steve and his collaborators have been working on for the past few years between Iron Maiden tours and releases, it is an album that will surprise and delight music fans the world over.\r\n\r\nWith a decidedly heavy rock-vibe this roaring debut paints with a full palette of sounds; brooding, melancholic, righteously indignant and exuberantly heavy. With Kevin Shirley at the mixing helm \u2013 whose credits include Iron Maiden as well as Led Zeppelin, Journey and Rush among many others \u2013 this is an album to sink your teeth into.\r\n\r\nFrom the growling riffage of opening salvo This Is My God to the heavy forlorn balladry of follow-up Lost Worlds which showcases Richard Taylor\u2019s soaring vocals, it\u2019s clear that \u2018British Lion\u2019 is an altogether different beast from Maiden.\r\n\r\nKarma Killer, with its dirge-like muscularity, and Us Against The World, with its massive chorus, demonstrates just how far \u2018British Lion\u2019 has flexed Steve Harris\u2019 considerable musical muscle. Dovetailed with guitarist David Hawkins\u2019 positively gargantuan lyrical guitar melodies, it\u2019s a mere hors d'oeuvre ahead of the epic, riffing-feast of The Chosen Ones, with its swaggering bravado.\r\n\r\nA World Without Heaven, at a breathtaking seven minutes and infused with progressive elements without ever teetering into self-indulgence illustrates perfectly these songsmiths\u2019 colossal abilities to create a mood and stay there. Supercharged by Steve Harris\u2019 inimitable style, there\u2019s an un-cynical vibe here that\u2019s as refreshing as it is out of place in today\u2019s all-too-categorised music industry.\r\n\r\nAnd as far as the name \u2018British Lion\u2019; \u201cI\u2019ve always been proud to be British,\u201d explains Steve, \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why I shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s a massive part of being me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m flag-waving or trying to preach, this is not a political statement at all. It\u2019s like supporting your football team, where you come from. I just think it lends itself to some really strong imagery too, and to me it fits in with the sound.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith Iron Maiden, Steve Harris has become one of the most recognised and successful ambassadors for British music on the world stage. Having released 15 studio albums, sold over 85 million records worldwide and played more than two thousand gigs in 58 countries in the band\u2019s thirty-five year career, his appeal is truly global. \r\n\r\nAnd now with \u2018British Lion\u2019, Steve steps out from Iron Maiden\u2019s illustrious shadow to present a different side of his musical visions.\r\n\r\nThe tracklisting for \u2018British Lion\u2019 is as follows:\r\n\r\n1.This Is My God\r\n2.Lost Worlds\r\n3.Karma Killer\r\n4.Us Against The World\r\n5.The Chosen Ones\r\n6.A World Without Heaven\r\n7.Judas\r\n8.Eyes Of The Young\r\n9.These Are The Hands\r\n10.The Lesson Timeline Photos",

But a crowd this loud and supportive soon blew the cobwebs away \u2013 thank you Charlotte!\u201d\r\n\r\nBass player Steve Harris added \u201cIt was fantastic to see so many fans since we were last here with the original Seventh Son tour 24 years ago.

          "MAIDEN ON THE CHARGE\n\nIron Maiden announce \"Maiden England World Tour\" with extensive dates in North America this summer\n\nVery Special Guest Alice Cooper to July 21, Coheed and Cambria after July 21.\n\n\nFollowing the massively successful Final Frontier World Tour 2010-11, IRON MAIDEN are back on the road this summer with a series of Arena, Amphitheatre and Festival shows in the U.S.A. and Canada, opening in Charlotte, NC, U.S.A. on June 21, and finishing in Houston, TX, on Aug 18 (dates listed below), to be followed by further dates around the World in 2013. The MAIDEN ENGLAND WORLD TOUR will closely mirror, in terms of production and content, the original 1988 concert video of the same name, shot on the \u201cSeventh Son Of A Seventh Son Tour\u201d. This opening section of the World Tour is the band\u2019s most extensive visit to North America for many years and includes a number of cities the band have not played in a very long time, such as Charlotte, Atlanta, Buffalo, Indianapolis and Salt Lake City.\n\nIn most venues, tickets will go on sale on March 2 and 3 but watch this site or check local venue information for fuller details. Fan Club members should check out ironmaiden.com for exclusive first day ticket presales and contest to be \u2018First To The Barrier\u2019.\n\nMAIDEN ENGLAND marks the third chapter in the History of Iron Maiden, a journey which began in 2004 with The Early Days DVD and subsequent 2005 Early Days Tour. Part Two followed in 2008 with the Live After Death DVD - the seminal 1984 concert recorded at Long Beach Arena (L.A) during the World Slavery Tour - and the band embarking on their groundbreaking Somewhere Back In Time World Tour 2008/9, which saw them play to over two million fans in almost 40 countries.\n\nComments vocalist Bruce Dickinson, \u201cWe have great fun playing the History of Maiden Tours because it gives us an opportunity between new albums to go out and play songs from our earlier catalogue. It\u2019s always fantastic seeing the crowd reaction from a new generation of fans who have never experienced some of these tracks performed live before, and of course we know our longstanding fans will enjoy seeing the original Seventh Son Tour re-visited - with many other surprises! Our intention is to play about two thirds of the original track list of Maiden England (shown below*), including some songs we have not played live in a very,very long time, plus other favourites we just know the fans are going to want to hear! We always try to give our fans a great show musically, but we have always tried to make it as entertaining and memorable an experience as we can visually. And we all feel this show is going to do that splendidly! We can't wait to get started in Charlotte\u201d.\n\nIron Maiden are delighted to announce that the extraordinary and legendary Alice Cooper will be their Very Special Guest on all shows up to July 21. After that date, Special Guest will be Coheed and Cambria, the inspiring, cutting edge band from New York. \n\nIron Maiden continue to be actively dedicated to ensuring their fans always have full access to the best possible tickets in the fairest possible way. Manager Rod Smallwood comments:\n\n\u201cWe are trying to ensure that our fans get the tickets they want in the prime positions without paying over the odds to ticket scalpers. Maiden get infuriated with the way fans sometimes have to pay more than the ticket price to get good positions at our shows. So we will, wherever possible (Festivals excluded), with the assistance of the Promoters, arrange a paperless ticketing system at least for the front sections to try to eliminate as much of the ticket scalping and exchanges as we can. We put this into practice on our North American Tour in 2010; it worked well and we received many positive comments back from our fans, so we intend to increase this where feasible. With paperless ticketing, only those who actually pay initially for the tickets will get into the show so scalping is generally avoided (please see the comments from Ticketmaster below). We are also doing everything we can to avoid any drain of prime tickets going to the Secondary Ticketing sites which we feel make unfair profits from music fans.\n\nAs we consider all our fans to be VIPs, no tickets will be held specifically for VIP use. At some venues, the Promoter may provide the option for fans to pay extra for \u201cVIP Parking\u201d, early access, access to \u201cVIP Bar\u201d etc. But these will be purely optional for ticket holders only and will not be tied to ticket locations \u2013 the ability to get the best tickets should be the same for everybody outside of the usual presales. \n\nFinally, we are of course once again arranging exclusive ticket pre-sales for our fan club members so they can be quick off the mark for great tickets and will also continue to run the contest in appropriate venues for fan club members so they can be \u2018First To The Barrier\u2019 prior to the show. We hope that these measures will help our fans as much as possible and ask that they keep checking for details on our website.\u201d\n\nTICKETMASTER comments: \nWhere possible the North American Iron Maiden shows will operate a paperless ticket policy. Select tickets will be sold via Ticketmaster\u2019s Paperless Ticket delivery, which means fans will not receive a physical concert ticket for their entry into the event. Buying paperless helps ensure fans have secure and convenient access to event tickets at the intended original sale price. On the day of show, concert goers just need to bring the credit card they used for the ticket purchase and a government-issued photo ID to the concert. All members of the ticket purchaser's party must be present at the same time to enter the venue. The venue\u2019s ticket usher will swipe their credit card upon entry and present each person in their party with seat locator slips for quick access into the show. To purchase paperless tickets or for more information, fans should visit www.ticketmaster.com/paperless or call the Ticketmaster charge-by-phone number at 1-800-745-3000.\n\n\n*Maiden England 1988 Longform Video VHS Tracklisting \nMoonchild, The Evil That Men Do, The Prisoner, Still Life, Die With Your Boots On, Infinite Dreams, Killers, Can I Play With Madness, Heaven Can Wait, Wasted Years, The Clairvoyant, Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, The Number Of The Beast, Hallowed Be Thy Name, Iron Maiden.\n\n\nMAIDEN ENGLAND 2012 TOUR DATES:\n\n21st June - Charlotte, NC - Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre\n23rd June - Atlanta, GA - Aarons Amphitheatre\n26th June - Boston, MA - Comcast Center\n27th June - Wantagh, NY - Jones Beach\n29th June - Philadelphia, PI - Susquehanna Bank Center\n30th June - Washington, DC - Jiffy Lube Live\n2nd July - Newark, NJ - Prudential Center\n5th July - Chicago, IL - First Midwest Bank\n8th July - Quebec, QC - Colisee Pepsi Arena\n11th July - Montreal, QC - Bell Center\n13th July - Toronto, ON - Molson Amphitheatre\n14th July - Sarnia, ON - Bayfest\n16th July - Buffalo, NY - Darien Lake Performing Arts Center\n18th July - Detroit, MI - DTE Music Theatre\n19th July - Indianapolis, IN - Klipsch Music Centre\n24th July - Winnipeg, MB - MTS Center\n26th July - Calgary, AB - Scotiabank Saddledome\n27th July - Edmonton, AB - Rexall Place\n29th July - Vancouver, BC - Pacific Coliseum\n30th July - Auburn, WA - White River Amphitheatre\n1st August - Salt Lake City, UT - USANA Amphitheatre\n3rd August - San Francisco, CA - Shoreline Amphitheatre\n6th August - Phoenix, AZ - Ashley Furniture HomeStore Pavilion\n9th August - Irvine, CA - Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre\n12th August - Albuquerque.

          "EMI are proud to announce the release of a new live IRON MAIDEN Blu-Ray, 2DVD Set and Double Soundtrack Album on Monday March 26th (March 27th Canada and USA (via UMe)).\n\n\"EN VIVO!\" was filmed on 10th April 2011 in front of over 50,000 ecstatic fans at the Estadio Nacional, Santiago during the Round The World In 66 Days leg of The Final Frontier World Tour, and captures a magnificent performance by the band, ardently embraced by the legendary Latino passion and energy of their Chilean fans. With spectacular stage backdrops, dynamic musicianship and a literally jaw-dropping appearance by Eddie, this live show encapsulates to perfection the heart and soul of Iron Maiden 2011.\n\nBass player and founder member Steve Harris comments \"For The Final Frontier Tour it was really important to me that we filmed in South America as we're always so overwhelmed by the fans' reaction when we go to that part of the world and I wanted to reflect that in the filming. After much consideration we chose the Santiago show as we felt it was one of our best performances of the entire Tour and to play at the prestigious Estadio Nacional was a landmark moment for us. For reasons known to our fans, it took a long time before we got to play our first show in Chile, and once we did get to play a show, the response was so phenomenal we just had to keep coming back and it's got better and better each time!\n\nThis show also features the gigantic new Eddie. He wasn't due to make his appearance until our European leg of the tour later in 2011, but we managed to transport him across the sea in a special huge container just in time for the latter end of the South American dates so it was great we were able to immortalize him for the DVD as he really has to be seen to be believed!\"\n\nThe concert was filmed digitally using 22 HD cameras and an octocam (a flying camera which captures aerial crowd scenes), recorded in both stereo and 5.1 audio and mixed by Maiden's longstanding producer Kevin \"Caveman\" Shirley, all of which serves to accentuate the incredible atmosphere of this compelling performance. Extensive use is made of split screens so fans can follow the individual members closer and the set list moves seamlessly between songs from Maiden's most recent studio album, 2010's The Final Frontier through to classic fan favourites via the band's vast and varied catalogue. (full set listing below).\n\nDVD Disc Two is a Bonus Disc containing an 88-minute documentary, BEHIND THE BEAST. This is also an entirely in-house production by Maiden's own Krew, led by Andy Matthews, and is intended as an interesting and revealing high quality \"home movie\" for their fans of how to put on an Iron Maiden tour and what goes on behind the scenes at a show. It describes the extraordinary story of one of the most acclaimed and ambitious touring shows in the world. It illustrates the day to day life and complex tasks of the Maiden Killer Krew and the other characters behind the scenes.
