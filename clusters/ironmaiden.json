          "12 de Marzo de 1956.\nNace Steve Harris (cuyo nombre verdadero es Stephen Percy Harris), en Leytonstone, Londres, Inglaterra.\nEs el fundador, bajista, teclista, compositor principal, y l\u00edder de la banda m\u00e1s grande de heavy metal de \u00e9ste planeta: IRON MAIDEN.\nFund\u00f3 Maiden en el a\u00f1o 1975 junto a Dave Murray, es el \u00fanico miembro de la banda que ha grabado en todos los discos a lo largo de los casi cuarenta a\u00f1os de carrera de la banda.\nEs un gran aficionado al f\u00fatbol y fan\u00e1tico del West Ham United, sin embargo, dej\u00f3 todo para formar Iron Maiden. Hasta el d\u00eda de hoy practica el deporte durante las giras de la banda, con la cual incluso tiene un equipo, el Iron Maiden FC.\nBajista autodidacta, su primer bajo fu\u00e9 una copia de un Fender Telecaster Bass y lo obtuvo el a\u00f1o 1971 por el precio de 40 libras esterlinas. Hace unos cuantos a\u00f1os Fender dise\u00f1\u00f3 con \u00e9l un bajo con su firma.\nHarris ha sido influenciado fuertemente como m\u00fasico, sobre todo por los bajistas de hard rock de fines de los 60s y principo de los 70s siendo los principales: Rinus Gerritsen de Golden Earring, Mel Schacher de Grand Funk Railroad, Chris Squire de Yes, Mike Rutherford de Genesis, Geezer Butler de Black Sabbath, John Entwistle de The Who; John Paul Jones de Led Zeppelin, Greg Lake de Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Roger Glover de Deep Purple, Glenn Cornick de Jethro Tull (una de sus bandas favoritas).\nPero uno de los bajistas realmente preferidos de Steve Harris fue Pete Way, de UFO, quien influy\u00f3 fuertemente en el estilo de ejecuci\u00f3n de Harris y tambi\u00e9n como persona y m\u00fasico en general; es m\u00e1s Maiden versiona un tema de Ufo.\nEl nombre de Iron Maiden, lo tom\u00f3 a partir de un instrumento de tortura medieval llamado \"doncella de hierro\" (Iron Maiden) que aparec\u00eda en una pel\u00edcula antigua llamada \"The Man With the Iron Mask\".\nEn febrero de 2013, Harris lanz\u00f3 su \u00e1lbum debut como solista, British Lion. El cual lo llevo a realizar una mini gira de 24 fechas por Europa.\nSteve Harris com\u00fanmente utiliza un bajo de cuatro cuerdas. \u00c9l comenta que s\u00f3lo usa ese tipo de bajo porque considera que con \u00e9l produce el sonido tradicional de Iron Maiden.\nSteve Harris es considerado por muchos uno de los mejores y extraordinarios bajistas en la historia del rock y del heavy, tanto por su aguerrido y particular estilo sobre el escenario, como por su calidad como compositor.\nSu estilo tocando el bajo es muy amplio y variado: desde sus famosos galopes alternando los dedos \u00edndices y coraz\u00f3n, hasta la ejecuci\u00f3n de powerchords, adem\u00e1s de riff complejos y mel\u00f3dicos en muchos temas considerados cl\u00e1sicos de Iron Maiden. \nHarris asegura que no realiza ejercicios de calentamiento antes de tocar.\nEn la composici\u00f3n, a la hora de escribir las letras suele tomar como fuente de inspiraci\u00f3n la Historia, la mitolog\u00eda o pel\u00edculas.\nEn la actualidad el nuevo \u00e1lbum de los Maiden est\u00e1 listo y s\u00f3lo se espera la recuperaci\u00f3n vocal de su cantante para lanzarlo e iniciar la nueva gira mundial que todos estamos esperando.\nFeliz Cumplea\u00f1os maestrazo...!",
