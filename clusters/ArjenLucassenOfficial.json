If you're ever looking for new musicians/ instruments in that genre you should consider using one of these guys. Some bands are so unique that you cannot find any other band like it. I think Ayreon and Altan Urag both fit that description very well. Well truth be told: all good things start with an A.\n\nAnyway I'm looking forward to your next Ayreon album. Do you think you can finish it before december so that I can ask it as a christmas present (of red je het al voor pakjesavond)?\n\nVriendelijke groet vanuit het vlakke Flevoland.

          "Today it's about the Ayreon story timeline that's right the whole thing.\nI think you can see the genius of storytelling by Arjen Anthony Lucassen here.\nThe timeline of the Ayreon universe spans many billions of years.\nPre-big bang Chaos.                                                             The primoridal condition before the creation of the known universe, where all matter, energy and time exist as one. (Chaos) \nBillions of years ago\n14 billion BC The Big Bang.\nThe first soul, the Universal Migrator is born. It subsequently divides into inumerable individual entities that roam the universe, breathing life among planetary systems. (Dawn of a Million Souls) \n8 billion BC The Flight of the Migrator. \nOne of the migrators traverses space and time in search of an uninhabited planet (Earth) to breathe life into, as virtually experienced later by the Mars Colonist in the Dream Sequencer.\n6 billion BC The Age of Shadows.\nThe Age of Shadows begins on the planet Y. The Forever race's dependence on technology finally renders them slaves to their machines. After this transition, they are granted immortality through science but in the process forget the essence of their being, losing even the ability to feel emotion. (Age of Shadows/We Are Forever) \n5 billion BC M 31. \nIn the Andromeda Galaxy, a migrator passes Y without effect noticing it is already inhabited by the Forever. (Out of the White Hole). Forever seed a passing comet with their own DNA and divert it to follow in the trail of the migrator in an effort to revitalize their race. (Newborn Race, Ride the Comet). \n4 billion BC The Tree of Life. \nThe Migrator reaches Earth and breathes life onto the planet. (To the Solar System). \nMillions of years ago\n65 million BC The Fifth Extinction.\nThe fifth extinction is caused when the Forever's comet collides with Earth. The cataclysm wipes out the dinosaurs which the Forever determine to be a \"lower form of intelligence\". The seed the Forever planted on Earth now waits dormant for the right conditions to flourish. (The Fifth Extinction) \nThousands of years ago\n50,000 BC The Stone Age. \nThe first Humans stand erect. (The First Man on Earth).\nThe dormant Forever DNA blends with the Human gene pool resulting in accelerated mental and cultural development. (Waking Dreams). \n6th century\nAD 584 The Dark Ages.\nAyreon recieves visions from the year 2084 sent back in time in an effort to change humanity's future. Blind all his life and suddenly able to see nothing but horror, Ayreon sets out on his quest to King Arthur's court to sing the visions to the most powerful man on Earth. (The Final Experiment: \"Prologue\", \"The Dawning\", \"King Arthur's Court\", \"Visual Echoes\").\nMerlin overcome by jealousy of the true prophet's powers, deems him evil and untrustworthy and kills him using his magic. (The Final Experiment: \"Merlin's Will and Ayreon's Fate\")\nAyreon, though physically dead, his spirit is now set free to roam the universe and find his new home.

This week, there's a lot on Noyan and Eden's plate, with new music and music byproducts from Oddland (!), Orphaned Land, Mephistopheles (!), Jimmy Pitts and Equipoise, Imperium Dekadenz official, Drudkh (Official), INQUISITION Official, Periphery, Gojira (just a clip), Hadal Maw, Iron Maiden, Exotype and Ayreon. \n\nThen, the two discuss the split between Obscura and Fountainhead and its continuing echoes, a fascinating article about natural language analysis and metal, Insomnium cancelling a show in Turkey and the recent trend of sexual assaults in metal festivals.\n\nFinally, the two dive deep into the complicated and divisive discography of none other than In Flames, a once great metal band which is...not so great nowadays. Regardless, their role in the history of metal is undisputed and some of their albums are absolute masterpieces.\n\nAs always, thank you so much for listening! We appreciate you all very much.\n\nhttp://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2016/07/11/38-were-not-even-trying/ 38 \u2013 We\u2019re Not Even Trying I actually enjoyed the \"don't really bother to put stuff in the description\" format as it makes my life easier,\u2026",
