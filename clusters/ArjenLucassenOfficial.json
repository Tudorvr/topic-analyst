          "\"01011001\" is the seventh studio album by Arjen Anthony Lucassen's long-running Ayreon project. \"01011001\" is the binary representation of the ASCII value of the letter Y.\n\nSeventeen singers in total (including Lucassen himself) contributed to the album, more than any other Ayreon album. Of these, except Lucassen, only Anneke Van Giersbergen (ex- theGathering) and Floor Jansen (After Forever and Nightwish) have sung on previous Ayreon albums: Van Giersbergen on Into the Electric Castle, Jansen on The Dream Sequencer.\n\nIt also stars, among others, Bob Catley from Magnum, Hansi K\u00fcrsch from Blind Guardian, Jorn Lande, Jonas Renkse  and Steve Lee from Gotthard  in his final guest appearance before his death in 2010. The album was a commercial and critical success.\n\nFrom \"01011001\", we bring for you today \"We are forever\", an amazing song with two beautiful voices: Anneke Van Giersbergen and Jonas Renkse.\n\n~ Racing heart\n\nhttps://youtu.be/I1tzSvZy4N8 Ayreon - We Are Forever (ft.

The 11 shows went very well and lots of venues were actually sold out, the audiences were absolutely fantastic and gave us the warmest welcome we could wish for. The chemistry between Anneke, me and the crowd felt just perfect. However ... I\u2019m afraid this doesn't necessarily mean I\u2019m going to take up touring again. I\u2019m not sure yet if the advantages (seeing the crowd\u2019s happy faces, meeting them and of course the playing) outweigh the disadvantages (travelling, lack of sleep, endless waiting, back pain and anxiety). I must say that Anneke definitely pulled me through this, she\u2019s so positive and optimistic and a true professional! And of course the enthusiastic reactions of the audiences helped too, I\u2019m truly honored and moved.
