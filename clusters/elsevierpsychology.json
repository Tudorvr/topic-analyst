I know with practice the left-hand can learn to do things but the right-hand seldom if never needs to learn new things as it knows the hand eye can relate safe moves over all moves this is not possible left-handed\nThis means there is huge bias in the brain for right-handed use. and the lefthand is not capable of skilled work, jobs\n\nAs each hand is controlled by different hemispheres then the ability of the 2 hemisphere is vastly different\nthis to me is not balanced thinking or balanced body use or control.\n\nI was right-handed 30 years i never cared once for my lefthand limited ability or even noticed its stuck as right-hand did everything..
