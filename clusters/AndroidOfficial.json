          "Good morning & happy Friday! We're looking at a quiet start to what will be a great day to kick off the weekend. Clear skies will be with us all afternoon, even though a weak low pressure system will pass by. This will bring in downsloping wind from New Mexico. The wind will come down the mountains, warm, then spread east into west Texas. That's why we'll see wind at 10-15 mph & highs in the lower 70s this afternoon. \n\nThere will be mostly sunny skies for Saturday. The wind will be the big story for tomorrow...only because it will be light, at 5-10 mph for once. That means the warm air will fee even warmer. The wind will be from southwest tomorrow, which will bring in the warmth & just enough moisture to have puffy cumulus clouds around. We'll see the high temperature jump up to 74\u00b0 for Lubbock. It will feel warmer in the sun, so get out & enjoy the day!\n\nClouds will be on the increase on Sunday, as a low pressure system passes by, once again. So, expect a cloudy afternoon, but the air will still be warm enough to have highs above average. Lubbock will see a high of 68\u00b0. The wind will be from the southwest at 10-15 mph all day long. There will be isolated storms in the Rolling Plains at 10%, then we'll dry from west to east in the evening.\n\nBy Monday, dry conditions take over for basically the entire week. Skies will clear with dry air over the South Plains, so we'll see sunny skies & warmer air once more. Lubbock is going to see wind at 10-15 mph for Monday, with a high of 70\u00b0. 70\u00b0 readings will be here to stay through at least Thursday. The wind will be sticking around, as well, especially at the wind of the week when blowing dust returns to the South Plains.\n\nDon't forget to download the KLBK First Warning Weather App, FREE on Android & Apple devices.

          "Good morning! The bulk of the showers & sleet/snow mix have already moved east of our area today. A low pressure system to the southwest is going to help pull in more rain this morning. The radar is showing light snow in Parmer & Curry Counties. However, with surface temperatures above freezing, I doubt it's actually snow. This precipitation may fall as snow, but not do anything once it reaches the ground.\n\nFor the remainder of the day, we'll be looking at light showers moving through the area this morning. If there is going to be any extremely light snow, it will be in Curry & Parmer Counties & will not accumulate. The rest will see the light rain end by noon. The remainder of the day will be cloudy & chilly with a high temperature in Lubbock of only 41\u00b0. So stay bundled up today!\n\nOvernight, we'll actually be looking at clearing skies as this low pressure system scurries to the east. It will bring severe thunderstorms to parts of east & southeast Texas this evening, but will dry things out for west Texas. With the clear skies & light wind overnight, lows will be dropping down into the upper 20s for Lubbock. The northwest counties will be in the low & mid 20s, so don't be surprised to find a few slick spots on the roads tomorrow morning northwest of Lubbock.\n\nWednesday will clear out & will begin the another warm-up for this week. An upper-level ridge of high pressure is going to keep things calm & quiet. Skies will be sunny & the wind will only be at 5-10 mph. The air flow will shift to the west & southwest, which is the reason for the warmer air. Lubbock will reach a high of 57\u00b0 tomorrow, which is still below the average of 59\u00b0, but will feel warmer in that sunshine. \n\nDon't forget to download the KLBK First Warning Weather App, FREE on Android & Apple devices.

          "Good morning! We have quite the tricky forecast coming up for today & tomorrow. We do know that cloudy skies will stay with us all day long. There's already a mix of rain & snow falling in the northwestern counties. Temperatures at the surface are above freezing for those areas now, so accumulation of any ice is going to be unlikely. You should still be careful while driving & watch for the wet spots on the roads.\n\nThe rest of the day will see temperatures dropping into the mid 30s on the Caprock & low 40s in the Rolling Plains. There will be a rain/snow mix, or light snow showers across Parmer, Castro, Swisher, Bailey, Lamb & Hale Counties. The rest of the area is going to see rain showers & I can't even rule out a few thunderstorms. The highs for the day have already occurred just past midnight. Coverage of precipitation today will be at 80%.\n\nTonight's forecast is even more tricky the the day. Clouds will stay & lows for the Caprock will stay a few degrees either side of freezing. The Rolling Plains will see lows above freezing, so any precipitation that falls off the Caprock will remain rain. The northwestern counties will see snow showers tonight, with 1-2\" of accumulation possible. There will be higher amounts, closer to 3-4\" from Happy, to Canyon & Amarillo. \n\nBy Tuesday morning, I can't rule out light snow for Lubbock, with a dusting on the grassy surfaces, with isolated areas seeing a dusting on the roads. Watch for slick spots in the morning hours, especially during the morning commute. By the afternoon, there will be rain showers for most locations at 50%. Things will begin to clear off & dry out by the evening & overnight hours. Highs on Tuesday will stay in the low 40s, which is the reason for afternoon rain, instead of snow.\n\nDon't forget to download the KLBK First Warning Weather App, FREE on Android & Apple devices.

I noticed today while using my phone that if you type in the word \u5916\u56fd\u4eba (gaikokujin, foreigner), autocomplete offers an emoticon of a person with a big nose as a suggestion for input. This is similar to typing in \u30cf\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc (\"happy\") and getting an option for a smiley face, except you know, racism. The same racist emoticon pops up if you type in \u5916\u4eba, which literally means outsider and is a racial epithet directed towards minorities. \n\nThis is a preset feature, so I was wondering if you could help me understand where this racist smutt is coming from, and who to contact about it. (Pics or it didn't happen, so please see attached screencap.) Certainly the Android development team isn't espousing this sort of racism, right?",
